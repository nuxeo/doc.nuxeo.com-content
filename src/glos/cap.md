## Content Application Platform (CAP)

It is the basic set of features of the Nuxeo Platform, so as to offer a minimal set of document management features that can be used to develop content management applications while keeping it lean and thin.

CAP features include:

*   different content creation and edition means (forms, Drag & Drop, desktop integration),
*   environments dedicated to collaboration on content, distribution of content, the administration of the application,
*   collaborative features such as comments,
*   workflows to approve documents and publish them.

More information about CAP on the page [Nuxeo Platform Concepts]({{page space='nxdoc' page='nuxeo-platform-concepts'}}).
