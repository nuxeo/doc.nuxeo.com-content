## Deployment Overview

The Nuxeo Cloud team deploys all changes to Production and Pre-Production Environments via Marketplace Packages.

JIRA deployment requests should be submitted up to 2 days before the change is required. The request should also include when the deployment should take place.

Some important notes regarding deployments:
- Snapshot or Date-Based Releases are NOT allowed in PreProd and Prod environments. The Nuxeo Cloud Team only deploys production-ready code.
- Marketplace Package versions should be used. The Nuxeo Cloud team will NOT deploy the same Marketplace Package to the same environment multiple times.
- If a Marketplace Package contains a configuration template please identify this in the Nuxeo Cloud Deployment request.  

Nuxeo Cloud has Standard Maintenance Windows for all of our Production and Pre-Production Environments. The standard maintenance windows are used to make changes to minimize impact to users.

The standard 7 days a week US, EU and Japan maintenance windows are identified below.

- **US**: 12AM - 2AM EST
- **EU**: 12AM CET - 2AM CET
- **Japan**: 12AM JST - 2AM JST

## Deployment Requests

All Nuxeo Cloud Deployments require a JIRA Support Ticket (SUPNXP) to be created with a ticket type of “Nuxeo Cloud Deployment” that provides the following information:

- Name and Link to the correct version of the Marketplace Package, including any configuration templates
- Required 3rd Party Services or SSO services (e.g. FFMPEG, ImageMagick, Okta, etc.).
- Nuxeo Conf Updates corresponding to packages or 3rd party services.
- The Date and Time of the deployment including time zone, which can be done outside of established maintenance windows.

Nuxeo Cloud requires a Date and Time for all Deployment Requests, this includes identifying the standard maintenance window as the deployment time.

## Nuxeo Studio and Private Marketplace Packages

Nuxeo Cloud customers have access to [Nuxeo Studio]({{page version='' space='studio' page='nuxeo-studio'}}) to configure their business logic, data model and define the public or private packages that are required.

The Private Marketplace is [available]({{page space='studio' page='delivering-a-customization-package-through-the-nuxeo-marketplace'}}) to customers for custom Java development.

Cloud Customers have the option to purchase Nuxeo Professional Service engagements to provide support for the development of additional configuration or customization changes.
