## Managing Local Nuxeo Drive Accounts

You can use Nuxeo Drive to synchronize content from several Nuxeo Platform applications. This means that you can set up several accounts on Nuxeo Drive. Accounts are managed from the **Accounts** tab of the [Settings window](#open-drive-settings).

### Adding a New Account

When you add a new account you need to provide the following information:

- **URL**: Type the URL of your Nuxeo application, either the domain name only (`example.org`) or partial URL (`https://example.org`) or a full URL (`https://example.org/nuxeo`).
- **Folder**: Select where you want your Nuxeo Drive folder to be created.

Clicking on **Connect** will open your browser to the login page. Sign-in and you will be redirected to Drive.

The creation of a new account triggers the following actions:

- A Nuxeo Drive folder is created at the location you chose (see section [Accessing the Nuxeo Drive Folder](#access-local-drive-folder)).
- Nuxeo Drive starts synchronizing the Nuxeo workspaces or folders you [indicated as synchronized](#synchronizing-workspaces-root) in the Nuxeo Platform. It will automatically update content when there is a modification on the server.
- In the **Nuxeo Drive** tab in your **Home**, an authentication token corresponding to the computer you are synchronizing from is displayed. The list of synchronized folders is displayed in the **Synchronization roots** section of the tab.

### Deleting an Account

You can delete accounts from your Nuxeo Drive at any time by clicking on the **Delete account** button of the corresponding account, in the **Settings** window. The local Nuxeo Drive folder is not deleted.

## Changing the Nuxeo Drive Language

By default, Nuxeo Drive is available in English.

**To change the language of Nuxeo Drive:**

1. Open the Nuxeo Drive Settings window.
2. Click on the **General** tab.
3. In the **Language** drop down list, select the language you want to use.</br>
    The Settings window language is immediately changed.
