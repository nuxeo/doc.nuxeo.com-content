## General

### Fixes

#### [macOS] Fix windows maximization not being reversible

On macOS, the maximization of certain windows could not be undone and the user was stuck in fullscreen. The only way to get out of the situation was to use the activity monitor to force kill Drive. This issue has been partially fixed by making the user able to restore the window to it's normal size when pressing the `Escape` key.

## Direct Transfer

### Improvements

#### Fix Direct Transfer window stealing the foreground focus

In some case, the fact that the Direct Transfer file selection window is always on top can be problematic for some users. This behaviour has been changed and the window won't steal the foreground focus anymore.
