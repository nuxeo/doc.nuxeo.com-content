If you need to move your Nuxeo Drive content from one computer to another, we suggest you to just  initiate an empty Nuxeo Drive on the new computer.

Another possibility is to use a [Microsoft Migration Tool](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc974331).

We do not recommend to copy the Nuxeo Drive files to USB keys to transfer them as it will not migrate all the data correctly.
