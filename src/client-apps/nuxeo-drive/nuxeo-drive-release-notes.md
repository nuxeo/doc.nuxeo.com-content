## General

### Fixes

#### [macOS] Opened Files

While trying to get the list of opened files, if the user closes one or more of them, then a silly error was fired and the list was not retrieved at all. We fixed the issue by doing a copy of that list as soon as possible, and then iterating on its items safely.

#### [macOS] Start On Boot Option

If, for a reason or another, the user does not have rights to write in their own local folders (typically the `$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents` folder), then the app cannot be registered to start on boot.
We mitiged the issue by simply logging a warning as there is not much more that can be done.

#### Using UTF-8 Everywhere

We made assumptions about the default encoding being always UTF-8. It seems we were not right and to prevent any problems, we are now specifying the UFT-8 encoding when reading/writing text files.

### Improvements

#### Device ID

The unique device ID is now showed in the About tab of Settings. It can be selected and copied to ease sharing it.

A new switch has been added in the Advanced Settings tab allowing the user to enable/disable errors reporting through Sentry.

## Direct Edit

### Fix

#### Handle Forbidden Filenames

In previous versions it was not possible to Direct Edit a file which name contained characters that are forbidden by the OS (ex: backslash on Windows). Those files are now handled correctly.

### Improvements

#### Handling of Files With No Associated Application

A notification message will now be shown if no associated application is found when opening a file through Direct Edit.

#### Handling of Invalid Data From Server

An error notification will now be shown if the server returns invalid data when opening a file through Direct Edit.

#### Better Experience

The Direct Edit experience has been made more robust by better handling HTTP 502 (Bad Gateway), 503 (Service Unavailable) and 504 (Gateway Timeout) errors during document locking/unlocking.

## Direct Transfer

### Fix

#### File Name Escaping

We fixed file name escaping when checking for document existence on the server when it could contain the `\r` character. This is likely to happen on macOS only but the prevention is available to all platforms.

## Synchronization

### Fix

#### [Windows] Deletion of UNC Names

We fixed an issue when local trashing files was not working with UNC names. Such mechanism is not available for shared folders and the behavior will now be to permanently delete those files (as Windows itself is doing).

#### Synchronization Feature State

When upgrading from Nuxeo Drive < 5.2.1 to 5.2.1, users may see that the synchronization feature is disabled, even if they did not explicitly disabled it.
We restored the correct behavior.
