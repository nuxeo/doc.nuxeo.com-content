## Upload with Direct Transfer on Web UI 

As of Web UI version 2025.x, the Direct Transfer capability has been natively integrated into the Web UI interface.
This enhancement enables users to initiate document uploads directly from the Web UI via Direct Transfer, eliminating the need to launch the Nuxeo Drive application. By streamlining the upload workflow, this integration minimizes context switching and reduces interaction overhead, thereby improving operational efficiency and user productivity.
