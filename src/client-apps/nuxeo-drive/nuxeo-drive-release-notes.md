## Task Management 

Starting for Nuxeo Drive 5.5.0 you will be able to handle your tasks directly from Nuxeo Drive. 
You can enable or disable this feature from the feature tab of your Nuxeo Drive application. 
Once a task is assigned to you, you will receive a notification in your notification center, you can click on it and directly arrive on document to review. 

A new button is available from the systray menu to access a popup listing the tasks created by you and the ones you are assigned to. You will be able to have a clear view of your remaining tasks, with the due dates, the document to review and the type of tasks.
