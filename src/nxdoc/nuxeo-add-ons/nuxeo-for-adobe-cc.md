## Functional Overview

### Finding Content (InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator)

The connector allows to Search and Browse your content.

The search tab allows you to search through all the repository at one time. The browse tab allows you to browse through the hierarchical setup of the repository. While browsing, you can still use the search bar; the search content is limited to the level in the hierarchy that you are currently viewing. You have the choice between a grid view (default) and a list view. You can toggle between view options using the buttons near the search bar.

![Adobe Browse tab](nx_asset://56631c62-1a5a-4e54-a683-00658ebf0b31 ?w=350,border=true)

#### Search Tab

By default, when logging into the repository via the connector, the first view you see is the search tab.
The search bar supports wildcard operations, as in the example, and search the full-text index of the repository (including file names, and metadata fields).

<!--     ### NX_ASSET ###

-->
![Adobe Search Tab](nx_asset://f0901da6-6aca-488f-b243-2a4fb3dcfc4d ?w=250,border=true)

Once you’ve entered your search terms in the Search field, clicking on the search icon lists the results below.

Results are shown in pages and you can navigate between pages using the arrow keys at the bottom of the panel.

Whenever using the connector, if you want to perform a search, you can choose **Search** from the Nuxeo CC Connector panel fly out menu, or just click on the Search widget.

To see more information about the object, double click the thumbnail to see more information.
Each object comes with a detail view containing:
- The thumbnail of the asset
- Filename/title, creator, usage info (mapped to dc:rights) and the lifecycle state.

![Adobe Ryan Walton Copyright](nx_asset://b9a94926-47fc-49cb-ac23-f98e0906a734 ?w=250,border=true)

To download a copy of an asset from Nuxeo CC Connector, click the blue download arrow to the right of the thumbnail to begin the download process. For more information, see Download Options in [Preferences section](#preferences).

#### Browse Tab

The browse tab is easy to use by clicking on the folders in the hierarchy. Note that as you click through the repository, a breadcrumb is generated just above the content view, which allows you to easily go back to any point within your path. Simply click on one of the levels to change location. If your path becomes too long to fit the panel, a slider appears to allow you to move “up” or “down” the path.

As indicated earlier, to see more information about an object, double click into the item to see the detail view, where you can also download the file.

#### Working in InDesign

The Nuxeo CC Connector fly out menu has several options to assist the user:
- **About** takes you to our [website](https://www.nuxeo.com/)
- **Refresh** re-establishes an updated connection to your current folder
- **Upload from Disk** opens your System Browser to upload an asset to your current Connector folder
- **Upload Selected** uploads locally placed assets in InDesign to your current Connector folder (be sure to use “Relink…” as described below once saved)
- **Upload InDesign Document** uploads open (If saved) InDesign doc to your current Connector folder. You will be presented with an Upload option to either, Upload New File, or Replace.
- **Compound Doc Info** ensures HTTP links record a proper ID on the Nuxeo Server
- **Upload All Non-HTTP Assets** uploads all locally placed InDesign assets from your open InDesign document to your current Connector folder
- **Relink to Current Folder** relinks locally placed InDesign assets to the Current Connector folder, if they can be found there
- **Preferences** opens Nuxeo CC Connector Preferences
- **About Silicon Publishing** takes you to siliconpublishing.com


We can use the above menu items to work with the Nuxeo repository from within the Creative Cloud application

Starting from a **new INDD file**:
1. Start with new INDD file
1. Locate items from within the repository to place
1. Once you’ve found an image to use, drag it into to your InDesign document (can be from any view).
    {{#> callout type='note' }}
    Before dropping it, releasing your mouse button to load your cursor with the asset’s thumbnail. Then drag your image to size and place it into your document.
    {{/callout}}
1. If you are a power user who needs InDesign’s **Show Import Options** for PDF or other image types, hold down the alt/option key when you drag and drop.
1. For local files, place them as usual, then use the connector menu panel to upload them to the repository.
1. Select the local files and choose to “upload selected items” in the menu list
or
1. Use the menu list and choose to “upload non-http items”
1. Once local items are in the repository, be sure to “relink to current location” from the menu list. This will ensure the links are maintained server side.
1. If you have not already browsed to the location where you want to store the InDesign file, use the browse tab to navigate to your intended destination.
Upload the INDD document using the Nuxeo CC Connector fly out menu (Upload Indesign Document).

You will be asked if you want to **Upload new file** or **Replace**. As a new file, you need to choose **Upload new file** and then **Upload**.

![](nx_asset://aea67a98-f744-4e9f-87cd-3efba00d1d22 ?w=350,border=true)


{{#> callout type='warning' }}
If you intend to continue working on this document, **immediately after** the initial save to the repository, **YOU MUST** first close the document, then open again by dragging and dropping the file from the panel, into the main InDesign window. This ensures future uploads of the file will be recognized as replacements for this file.
{{/callout}}

Working with an existing repository InDesign file:
To open InDesign files stored in the repository, simply drag and drop the file from the panel to the main view of the application.

After you have worked on your file (following instructions above for placing assets), use the Nuxeo CC Connector fly out menu to upload the file as before. This time, choose to “Replace” the file. This will override the previous version in the repository (and will version the file according to your company’s versioning policy in Nuxeo).

{{#> callout type='note' }}
If you did not open the InDesign file from the Connector panel (via drag and drop) and you choose “Replace”, you will still get a “new”/duplicate file in the repository.
{{/callout}}

Using the Nuxeo CC Connector includes features within the traditional InDesign Links panel as well.

![](nx_asset://8b19591e-f3a8-43fb-9fa6-04c3116200e2 ?w=350,border=true)

Choose to work with the high resolution (HQ) or low resolution (LQ) rendition of the file by double clicking the entry in the Nuxeo column in the panel (you might need to expose the column in the “Panel Options” seen in the panel fly out).
Be notified when updates have been made to the placed repository items, so that you can update the items in the InDesign document (note - you also see this on the placed image within the document)
Select a link and choose to “Reveal in Nuxeo” which will open the file in your Nuxeo web instance to see more information about the file.

#### Working in Photoshop/Illustrator

Photoshop and Illustrator have both access to Nuxeo CC Connector when you install the program.

If you want to edit an existing file from your Nuxeo account:
1. Drag and Drop your asset from Connector, just like you would in InDesign.</br>
    A copy of the file will be saved locally at `nuxeo_connector_files\downloads` in your Documents folder, and then opened in your Adobe application.
1. Make your edits in Photoshop or Illustrator and **save**.
1. Once your local file is saved, choose **Upload Photoshop (Illustrator) Document** from the Nuxeo CC Connector fly out menu.</br>
    You will be presented with an option to either, **Upload New File**, or **Replace**.

    <!--     ### NX_ASSET ###
        path: /default-domain/workspaces/Product Management/Documentation/Documentation Screenshots/NXDOC/Nuxeo for Adobe CC /Adobe Upload New file

    -->
    ![](nx_asset://d435ccfb-4624-4e6f-8ca9-91c440b856b9 ?w=350,border=true)


When edits are made to repository content using the Connector, users in InDesign who have placed the content will be notified that updates are available.

<!--## Known limitations

## Uninstalling Nuxeo CC Connector

Nuxeo CC Connector has two parts: an extension to provide the panel and a plug-in to provide the underlying linking technology.

### On Mac

- Remove the extension folder:
```
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/NuxeoCCConnector.
```

- Remove the plug-in folder:
```
/Applications/Adobe InDesign CC 2018/Plug-Ins/SiliconConnectorNuxeo.
```

### On Windows
You can use the Windows Control Panel to uninstall Nuxeo for Adobe CC like you would do with any other installed application. If you need to uninstall manually, you can remove the following folders:
- Remove the extension folder:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\CEP\extensions/NuxeoCCConnector.
```

- Remove the plug-in folder:
```
C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe InDesign CC 2018\Plug-Ins\SiliconConnectorNuxeo.
```

## Network Considerations (for Nuxeo Administrators)
Since Nuxeo CC Connector requires network access to Nuxeo and the Silicon Publishing licensing server, there are certain network requirements to consider. You may find that working from home, where there is not proxy or firewall, you can use Silicon Connector for Box without a problem, but at work you run into errors when trying to activate or use it.

### Proxy

You can configure your proxy settings in the `SC.properties` file located in:
- mac:
```
/Users/<username>/Library/Preferences/SiliconConnector/
```

- Windows:
```
C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\SiliconConnector\
```

This file can be edited with a basic text editor and is documented with definitions of each property. Properties should be formatted with `key=value syntax`, e.g. `sc.http.proxy_server=proxyserver.com`

### Firewall

If your company has a firewall, you will need to be sure to whitelist the Silicon Publishing licensing server. The url to whitelist is https://licensing.siliconpublishing.com.
