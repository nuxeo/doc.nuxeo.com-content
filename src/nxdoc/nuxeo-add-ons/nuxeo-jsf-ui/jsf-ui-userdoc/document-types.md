## Available Documents

### Domain

{{multiexcerpt 'definition-domain' page='document-types-in-web-ui'}}

### Workspace

{{! multiexcerpt name='definition-workspace'}}

There are two types of workspaces:

*   _shared workspaces_ are workspaces meant for collaborative work, that is to say that the workspace's content is meant to be shared and modified by several users. Collaborative workspaces are workspaces created in the root space called **Workspaces** and shared between users. Once documents are ready for distribution, they must be published in a section.

*   _personal workspaces_ can only be accessed by their owner, by default. You can of course share the access to your personal workspace with other users. Personal workspaces are accessible in the header of the application.

{{#> callout type='tip' heading='Personal workspaces behaviour'}}

Content creation and edition, as well as management, works the same way in personal workspaces as in collaborative workspaces.

{{/callout}}

By default, no workspace is available at workspaces root. Thus, you can create the structure you need for your project, edit it if needed. You can also [set the appropriate permission]({{page page='managing-permissions'}}) for users to be able to collaborate in the workspaces.

Workspaces management also includes setting [alerts]({{page page='collaborative-features'}}#alerts) for users to be informed when content is created or edited in workspaces and handling content deletion.

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

### Folder

{{multiexcerpt 'definition-folders-types' page='document-types-in-web-ui'}}

**Regular Folders**

{{multiexcerpt 'definition-folder' page='document-types-in-web-ui'}}
In a folder, you can:

*   [Create documents]({{page page='creating-content'}}) and do all the actions available on them (edit, approve, manage relations, etc.)
*   [Manage permissions]({{page page='managing-permissions'}})
*   [Subscribe to and manage alerts]({{page page='collaborative-features'}}#alerts)
*   [Manage the folder's trash]({{page page='deleting-content'}})

Like in a workspace, you can use drag and drop to create content in a folder.

**Ordered Folders**

{{multiexcerpt 'ordered-folders' page='document-types-in-web-ui'}}

### File

{{multiexcerpt 'definition-file' page='document-types-in-web-ui'}}

![]({{file name='file-summary.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)

To create a file, in the **Content** tab of the workspace, click on **New** button. On the window **Available document types**, click on the desired document. Fill in the document's creation form and click on the **Create** button.

{{#> callout type='tip' heading='Other ways to create a file'}}

You can also create a file using the[ **Import** button]({{page page='creating-content'}}#import-button) or using [drag and drop]({{page page='creating-content'}}#drag-and-drop).

{{/callout}}

When the file is created, users can enhance it by [filling its metadata]({{page page='editing-content'}}), adding attached files on it. When the document is completed, you can [publish]({{page page='publishing-content'}}) it in one or several section(s).

### Note

{{! multiexcerpt name='definition-note'}}

The note is a basic rich text container that consists in a text displayed in the **Summary** tab of the document. The note is usually created using the integrated rich editor, displayed in the note creation form. This editor enables layout modifications on the text.

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

![]({{file name='note.png'}} ?w=600,h=384,border=true)

The default format of the note is HTML. The other formats available are .txt, .xml and Markdown.

A note is composed of the fields below:

<div class="table-scroll">
<table class="hover"><tbody><tr><th colspan="1">
Field
</th>
<th colspan="1">
Description
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="1">
Title
</td>
<td colspan="1">
Note's title
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="1">
Description
</td>
<td colspan="1">
Text that explains what the note is about.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="1">
Content
</td>
<td colspan="1">
Text of the note created using a rich text editor.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="1">
Format
</td>
<td colspan="1">
Format of the automatically created file used to export notes from the Nuxeo Platform.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

To create a note, in the **Content** tab of the workspace, click on the **New** button. On the window **Available document types**, click on the desired document, fill in the document's creation form and click on the **Create** button.

{{#> callout type='tip' heading='Other ways to create a note'}}

You can also create a note by importing a .txt, a .html or a .xml file using [ **Import** button]({{page page='creating-content'}}#import-button) or [drag and drop]({{page page='creating-content'}}#drag-and-drop).

{{/callout}}

When the note is created, users can enhance it by adding [comments]({{page page='collaborative-features'}}#comments), attached files on it, or just [editing it]({{page page='editing-content'}}).

### Attachment

It is possible to add attachments to Files and Notes using the **Files** tab. This tab is available to users with at least Edit permission. There is no limit to the number of attachments.

For more information about attachment documents, read the page [Attachments]({{page page='attachments'}}).

### Collections

{{! multiexcerpt name='definition-collection'}}

[Collections]({{page version='' space='nxdoc' page='collections'}}) are a folder-like document in which you can classify existing documents. Documents are not actually copied or moved into the collection, which only holds a link to the document in its original location.

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

It enables you to create your own organization of the content without duplicating content and having the size of the content growing uncontrollably.

The list of collections available to you is available from your Home, in the **Collections** tab.

![]({{file name='collection-home-tab.png' page='collections-jsf-ui'}} ?w=650,border=true)

### Section

{{multiexcerpt 'definition-section' page='document-types-in-web-ui'}}
[Publishing]({{page page='publishing-content'}}) is controlled using a workflow, that requires publishing requests to be [approved]({{page page='publishing-content'}}) so documents can be seen in sections.

### Workspace Template

Templates are the easiest way to automate the creation of workspace tree structures. This is useful in many cases, for example when:

* You have many workspaces to create and want them to follow a certain structure of Folders, Files, or any type of documents.
* You want to keep a consistency among different workspaces that users will create. For example, you may want each team's workspace to have a mail folder, a "projects" workspace, etc.

To **create a template**, click on the left panel of Nuxeo Platform on **Templates**. Once a new Template has been created, you can create many workspaces from this template.

### Picture

Pictures are specific files. To take into account the specificities of pictures, their Summary tab shows additional pieces of information, such as:

* Rotate actions
* The picture's EXIF metadata
* Additional picture views

For more information about picture document, take a look to the [Digital Asset Management page]({{page page='digital-asset-management-with-the-nuxeo-platform'}}).

### Video

{{multiexcerpt 'definition-video' page='document-types-in-web-ui'}}

### Audio

Audio is a document types dedicated to audio files management. It provides a player from the document **Summary** tab to listen to it from the application.

Audio documents can be [created]({{page page='creating-content'}}) and [edited]({{page page='editing-content'}}) like any other document type. They don't have any specific tab or action available.

For more information about audio document, take a look to the [Digital Asset Management page]({{page page='digital-asset-management-with-the-nuxeo-platform'}}).

## Documents Evolution

The evolution of a document, each time contributors edit it, constitutes its lifecycle. This lifecycle is composed of the following states:

* **Project**: The document has been created and it can be modified
* **Approved**: The document has been approved and is considered as valid. Modifying it makes it back to project lifecycle state
* **Obsolete**: The document is not accurate anymore and, for instance, has been replaced by a new version
* **Deleted**: The document is moved into the workspace or folder trash

To change the lifecycle state of a document, you need to submit it to a [workflow]({{page page='workflows'}}).

{{#> callout type='warning' heading='Trash behavior deprecation'}}

Since 10.2, trash management is handled by `ecm:isTrashed` property and related [APIs]({{page page='deleting-documents'}}#putting-the-document-in-the-trash).

Changing the lifecycle state to `deleted` won't contribute to trash feature in future Nuxeo version.

{{/callout}}

## Containers Logic

When a document is folderish this means its a container in which you can create other documents (workspaces, folders, etc. are folderish documents).

It is possible to implement rules on containers to integrate the business logic of your application. In Nuxeo Studio when you select the folderish document facet, you have to choose which children are accepted in this document type. For example, in a folderish document type Library, if I have Edit permissions I can only create a children type Book in it.
