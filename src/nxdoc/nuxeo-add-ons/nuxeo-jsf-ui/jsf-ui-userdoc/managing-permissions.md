{{! multiexcerpt name='permissions-introduction'}}

A permission is a rule to grant access to a user or set of users to a Nuxeo document. User has a view in the dashboard where he can see the documents on which a permission is set. Managing permissions means granting or denying access permissions in a document or folder.

Some permissions are granted automatically, for example when you create a workflow and grant access to a user on a document for the entire workflow or a particular task.

## Managing Permissions on Content

### Granting Permissions to the Application Users and Groups

{{! multiexcerpt name='grant-permissions'}}

To add a permission, at the root of a workspace, a folder or a document, click on the **Permission** tab  **New Permission** and fill in the popup form.

The new permission is displayed in the **Permissions defined locally** part of the screen.

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

![]({{file name='add_permission_popup.png' page='810/userdoc/managing-permissions'}} ?w=350,border=true)

### Granting Permissions to External Users (Instant Share)

{{! multiexcerpt name='grant-permissions-external-users'}}

You can share documents and folders with people that don't usually have access to the application, using their email.

In the **Permissions Assigned to External Users** part of the screen, click **New** and fill in the popup form. The external user receives an email notification that contains the link to the document or space. They can access the application only by clicking that link.

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

![]({{file name='permissions_external_share_popup.png' page='810/userdoc/managing-permissions'}} ?w=300,thumbnail=true)

{{! multiexcerpt name='grant-permissions-external-users-notes'}}

**Notes:**

*   You can only grant a temporary access to external users.
*   External users have not created a user account on the application. They do not have login / password credentials. They can only use the link that is sent to them to access the application.
*   External users have access to the content that was shared with them (either documents or workspaces and their content) and the Search tab.
*   External users do not benefit from the personal workspace, the Home tab and their features (dashboard, alerts, users / groups search, etc.).

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

### Editing Permissions

To edit a permission click on ![]({{file name='editor_area.gif' space='studio' page='studio-icons-index'}}) next to it, from there you can modify the permission and/or the date frame.

### Deleting Permissions

To delete a permission click on ![]({{file name='delete_2.png' page='icons-index'}}) next to the permission you want to delete, click **Ok** on the confirmation popup.

![]({{file name='delete_permission_popup.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)

## Auditing and Purging Permissions

In the Admin Center, the Permissions tab presents two sub-tabs: a **Search** tab and a **Purge** tab.

### Auditing Permissions

The **Search** tab will help you to audit permissions in the repository, you can search by user/group, time frame, permissions etc. You can then export search results in an Excel file by clicking the icon ![]({{file name='xls_export.png' page='icons-index'}}).
![]({{file name='search_tab_permissions.png'}} ?w=600,h=304,border=true)

You can search permissions on the following criteria:

*   **User / Group**: The user(s) or group(s) of which you want to see the permissions.
*   **Granted by**: The user who assigned the permissions.
*   **Location**: The documents or folder hierarchy from which permissions will be searched.
*   **Right**: The permission to be searched for.
*   **Time Frame**: The dates during which the permission is / was effective.
*   **Status**: The status of the permission.
    *   Pending: The permissions is not yet active, the permission time range has not yet been reached.
    *   Effective: The permission is active.
    *   Archived: The permission is not active anymore, the permission time range is overdue.
*   **Policy Name**: The ID of the policy name. By default, there are two policy types:
    *   `local` for permissions granted locally
    *   `routing` for permissions granted by a workflow

### Purging Permissions

The **Purge** tab will enable admins to delete **all** the permissions granted to a user or on a section of the repository.

To **purge the permission** of a user: go to **Admin**&nbsp;> **Permissions**&nbsp;>  **Purge** tab, search the user you want and click on **Search**. The available permissions are displayed, click on **Purge** to confirm. All the permissions for this user are removed.
