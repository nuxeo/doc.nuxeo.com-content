The diff capabilities of the Nuxeo Platform now include picture comparison thanks to&nbsp;[Nuxeo Diff Pictures](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-diff-pictures).&nbsp;This addon displays a dialog where the user can spot the differences between two pictures. The compared pictures can be of different formats (JPEG, PNG, ...) or dimensions,&nbsp;leveraging ImageMagick capabilities in this area. When the two pictures have the same format and the same dimensions, the user can also set-up a "Fuzzy" comparison parameter (to remove noise when comparing JPEGs for example), and to choose the colors used for to highlight the differences.

When you compare two documents or versions of a document, the elements below are compared:

*   The metadata (title, coverage, modification date, etc),
*   The content.

You can compare documents in any space of the Nuxeo Platform: workspaces, sections...&nbsp;

## Comparing a Picture's Versions

**To compare two versions of a picture document:**

1.  On the picture document's&nbsp;**History**&nbsp;tab, click on the&nbsp;**Archived versions**&nbsp;sub-tab.
2.  Select the two versions you want to compare by checking the corresponding boxes.
3.  Click on the&nbsp;**Compare**&nbsp;button.
    The fields for which there has been changes between the two versions are displayed in a table, with the first version's values on the left and the second version's values on the right.
    ![]({{file name='picture-diff-changes.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)
4.  To visualize the changes on the picture, click on&nbsp;![]({{file name='action_diff.png' space='userdoc' page='nuxeo-diff'}})&nbsp;on the right.
    A window pops up showing what's been changed between the two versions.&nbsp;
    ![]({{file name='PictureDiff.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)

## Comparing Pictures

It is also possible to compare two distinct documents.

Select the documents:&nbsp;

*   If the pictures are in the same workspace, use the checkboxes and click on&nbsp;**Compare**.&nbsp;
*   If the pictures are in two different workspaces, add them to the worklist and click on&nbsp;**Compare**.

If you want to visualize the content changes, click on the icon&nbsp;![]({{file name='action_diff.png' space='userdoc' page='nuxeo-diff'}})&nbsp;on the right.&nbsp;A window pops up showing the differences between the two documents.
