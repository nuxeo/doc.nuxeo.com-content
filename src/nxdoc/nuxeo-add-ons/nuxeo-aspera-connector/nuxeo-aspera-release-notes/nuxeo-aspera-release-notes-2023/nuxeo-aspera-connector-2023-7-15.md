## What's New in Aspera for LTS 2023 (version 2023.7.15)
This is a bugfix and improvement release.

## Released Changes

### Opt Out of Updated Event in AsperaCompleteWork

Uploading assets via Aspera previously triggered both a "documentCreated" and a "documentUpdated" event, which resulted in duplicate notifications. This has been corrected so that only a single event is generated per asset upload, ensuring only one notification is sent, consistent with standard Nuxeo upload behavior.
<br/>[[NXCON-42](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXCON-42)]

### Initiate Aspera Download in One API Call

Previously, initiating an Aspera download required a call to GetChildrenBlobs, with results passed to another endpoint for further processing.â€¨This has been simplified: a client can now initiate a download directly with a single API call through a new endpoint.
<br/>[[NXCON-32](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXCON-32)]

### Fix Aspera Connector Functional Tests

Aspera connector functional tests were failing due to Node.js version incompatibilities. The tests have been fixed by upgrading and aligning with Node.js 22.
