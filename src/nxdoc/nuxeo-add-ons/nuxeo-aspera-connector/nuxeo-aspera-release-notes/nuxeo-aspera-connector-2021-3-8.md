## What's New in Aspera for LTS 2021 (version 2021.3.8)
This is a bugfix release.

## Released Changes

* Fix document fetch headers in Aspera web ui LTS 2021
<br/>[NXP-31462](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-31462)

* Fixed a cosmetic issue: Complete Error message is not showing when viewed from inside transfer LTS 2021
<br/>[NXP-31437](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-31437)

* Source contextData for Aspera uploaded documents
  Added contextData.source = "aspera" while completing the AsperaCompletionWork, before saveDocument(). Created custom versioning policy in local and tested it, custom versioning is happening based on the condition if contextData.source = "aspera".
<br/>[NXP-31230](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-31230)

* When same transfer is completed from two end simultaneously we are seeing multiple copy of same file.
When one transfer is in process we donâ€™t allow any other user to start the same user.
<br/>[NXP-31652](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-31652)
