What's New in Aspera for LTS 2021 (version 2021.3.8)
This is a bugfix release.

Released Changes
Fix document fetch headers in Aspera web ui LTS 2021
[NXP-31462]

Fixed a cosmetic issue: Complete Error message is not showing when viewed from inside transfer LTS2021
[NXP-31437]

Source contextData for Aspera uploaded documents
Added contextData.source = "aspera" while completeing the AsperaCompletionWork, before saveDocument(). Created custom versioning policy in local and tested it, custom versioning is happening based on the condition if contextData.source = "aspera".
[NXP-31230]

When same transfer is completed from two end simultaneously we are seeing multiple copy of same file
When one transfer is in process we donâ€™t allow any other user to start the same user
[NXP-31652]
