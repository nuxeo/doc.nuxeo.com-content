{{! excerpt}}
The [JSF to Web UI](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-jsf-to-web-ui) enables bookmarked URLs and links in notifications to be redirected to the new Web UI.
{{! /excerpt}}

We do not recommend to use this add-on if JSF UI is still installed on your server, since users will hardly be able to navigate in JSF UI. Clicking links in the navigation tree will redirect to Nuxeo Web UI typically.

## Installation
