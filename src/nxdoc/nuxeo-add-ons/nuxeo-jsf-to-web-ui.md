{{! excerpt}}
The [Nuxeo JSF to Web UI](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-jsf-to-web-ui) addon enables bookmarked URLs and links in notifications to be redirected to Web UI.
{{! /excerpt}}

{{#> callout type='note' }}
We do not recommend to use this addon if JSF UI is still installed on your server, since users will hardly be able to navigate to JSF UI.</br>
Clicking links in the navigation tree will redirect to Nuxeo Web UI typically.
{{/callout}}

## Installation

{{{multiexcerpt 'MP-installation-easy' page='Generic Multi-Excerpts'}}}


Once installed, all the links from JSF UI will automatically redirect to Web UI pages.
