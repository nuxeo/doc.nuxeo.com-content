Packages can be installed directly from the Admin tab, from the Marketplace or using the `nuxeoctl` script. Packages can be addons bringing new features or hotfixes providing corrections or small improvements. Some Nuxeo Packages are totally public, not requiring a Nuxeo Online Services account to install them. Others can only be installed on instances [registered on Nuxeo Online Services]({{page page='registering-your-nuxeo-instance'}}).

## Online Installation

### Installing a Package Using the nuxeoctl Script

{{! multiexcerpt name='nuxeoctl-note'}}

The instructions below provide the steps to follow to install a package using the `nuxeoctl` script, without detailed explanation about `nuxeoctl`. For an overview of this script, please read the page [nuxeoctl and Control Panel Usage]({{page space='NXDOC' page='nuxeoctl and+Control+Panel+Usage'}}).

For Windows users, use `nuxeoctl.bat` instead of `./nuxeoctl` commands below.

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

1.  Stop your server.

    ```bash
    ./nuxeoctl stop
    ```

2.  Get the name or ID of the package you want to download. You can get it from the package Marketplace URL: For instance, the ID of the EasyShare package ([https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/easyshare?version=1.1.1](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/easyshare?version=1.1.1)) is `easyshare-1.1.1`.

3.  Install the package.

    ```bash
    ./nuxeoctl mp-install easyshare-1.1.1
    ```

    The server checks possible dependencies.

    ```
    Detected Tomcat server.
    Nuxeo home:          /Users/NUXEO/Downloads/nuxeo-cap-6.0-tomcat
    Nuxeo configuration: /Users/NUXEO/Downloads/nuxeo-cap-6.0-tomcat/bin/nuxeo.conf
    Include template: /Users/NUXEO/Downloads/nuxeo-cap-6.0-tomcat/templates/common-base
    Include template: /Users/NUXEO/Downloads/nuxeo-cap-6.0-tomcat/templates/common
    Include template: /Users/NUXEO/Downloads/nuxeo-cap-6.0-tomcat/templates/default

    Dependency resolution:
      Installation order (1):        easyshare-1.1.1
      Unchanged packages (2):        nuxeo-web-mobile:1.6.0, nuxeo-spreadsheet:1.0.0
      Packages to download (1):      easyshare:1.1.1

    Do you want to continue (yes/no)? [yes]
    ```

4.  Confirm installation.

    ```text
    Do you want to continue (yes/no)? [yes] yes
    ```

    The package is downloaded and installed.

    ```
    Downloading [easyshare-1.1.1]...
    Added easyshare-1.1.1
    Installing easyshare-1.1.1
    ```

5.  Start your server.

    ```bash
    ./nuxeoctl start
    ```

### Installing a Package from the Admin Tab

The Admin tab includes a section called **Update Center** from which you can easily install hotfixes, updates, addons and your customizations. The Update Center features a **Packages from Nuxeo Marketplace** tab that shows the list of packages available from the Marketplace and allowing you to install these packages directly from your Nuxeo application.

**To install a package from the Admin tab:**

1.  As an administrator (Administrator/Administrator by default), in the **Admin** tab, click on the **Update Center** left tab.
2.  Click on the **Packages from Nuxeo Marketplace**.
    The list of available packages, including hotfixes and addons, is displayed. By default, only packages compatible with your version of the Nuxeo Platform are listed.
3.  Optionally, filter the list of packages:

    *   Uncheck the **Show only packages compatible with my distribution** box if you want to see all available packages;
    *   Select a type of package in the drop down list if you want to narrow the list to a package type (addon, hotfix);
    *   Check the **Show only new packages** box if you want to hide already downloaded packages from the list.
        ![]({{file name='Admin-Center-updateCenter.png'}} ?w=650,h=287,border=true)
4.  Click on the **Download** link of the package you want to install.
    A download in progress page is displayed while the package is being downloaded.
    ![]({{file name='package-downloading.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)
    When the download is finished, the list of packages is displayed again and the downloaded package has an **Install** link.
    ![]({{file name='package-downloaded.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)
    The package is also available from the **Local packages** tab of the Update Center.
5.  Click on the **Install** link to start the installation.
    ![]({{file name='package-installation-start-page.png'}} ?w=450,border=true)
6.  Start the installation by clicking on the **Start** button.

    {{#> callout type='note' heading='Packages with dependencies'}}

    If the package has some missing dependencies, the **Start** button is not displayed. You are displayed a series of steps to install the required dependencies.

    1.  If dependency packages are not already in the Local packages, you need to download them. Click on the **Download all packages** button.
        ![]({{file name='package-dependencies-download.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)
        Required packages are downloaded.
    2.  Click on the **Installation of package and dependencies** button.
        ![]({{file name='package-dependencies-installation.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)
        A page detailing the packages to be installed is displayed.
    3.  Click on the **Confirm install** button at the bottom of the page.
        ![]({{file name='package-dependencies-installation-confirmation.png'}} ?w=600,border=true){{/callout}}

    Once the installation is done, a confirmation screen is displayed.

7.  Click on the **Finish** button.

    ![]({{file name='package-installation-finish.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)

    You need to restart the application for the installation to be completed.
    ![]({{file name='package-restart-required.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)

    {{#> callout type='tip' heading='Hot-reload'}}

    <div class="message-content">

    Some packages don't required the server to be restarted to be fully installed.

    </div>

    {{/callout}}
8.  Click on the **Restart required** button to restart the server.
9.  On the pop-up displayed, click on the **OK** button to confirm restart.
    ![]({{file name='restart-confirmation-popup.png'}} ?w=300,border=true,thumbnail=true)

    You're displayed a Restarting page as the server is restarting.
    ![]({{file name='restarting-page.png'}} ?w=550,border=true)
    The server immediately restarts. The login page will automatically be displayed when the server is restarted.

### Installing a Package from the Marketplace

There are two ways to install a package from the Marketplace:

1.  installing it directly: this requires to be able to access the Nuxeo server as you're on the Marketplace.
2.  Downloading it first, and then installing it on the Nuxeo server.

**To install the package directly from the Marketplace:**

1.  On the Marketplace, click on the **Install** button of the package you want to install.
    ![]({{file name='Marketplace-package-page.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)
    A window pops up.
2.  Type the URL of the Nuxeo server on which you want to set up the package (and on which you have administrator credentials). For instance, `localhost:8080`.
    ![]({{file name='server-address-popup.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)
    Your Nuxeo application opens in a new window.
3.  Log in as an administrator, if you are not already.
    A confirmation page is displayed.
4.  Click on the **Start download** button to confirm that you want to download the package.
    ![]({{file name='package-download-confirmation-1.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)
    You are directed in the Admin tab.
5.  Click on the **Confirm and Start download** button to confirm downloading.
    ![]({{file name='package-download-confirmation-2.png'}} ?w=500,border=true)
    Once the package has been downloaded, you are displayed the **Packages from Nuxeo Marketplace** tab of the Update Center. The package has an **Install** button and is also available from the **Local packages** tab of the Update Center.
6.  Install the package by clicking on the **Install** link.
    A confirmation page is displayed.
7.  Click on **Start** to confirm installation.
    ![]({{file name='package-installation-start-page.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)
    Once the set up is achieved, a message from the server confirms that the installation was performed correctly.
8.  If required, restart the server by clicking the **Restart required** button that replaces **Install** and **Remove** buttons. Otherwise, the installation is completed and you're displayed an **Uninstall** button.

9.  On the pop-up displayed, click on the **OK** button to confirm restart.
    ![]({{file name='restart-confirmation-popup.png'}} ?w=300,border=true,thumbnail=true)

    You're displayed a Restarting page as the server is restarting. The login page is displayed as soon as the server is available again.
    ![]({{file name='restarting-page.png'}} ?w=500,border=true)

## Offline Installation

It is possible to install packages available on the Nuxeo Marketplace even if your server is not connected to the Internet. This takes two steps:

1.  Download the package from the Marketplace.
2.  Upload the package from the Update Center or install it using the `nuxeoctl` script.

### Installing a Package Offline Using the nuxeoctl Script

{{{multiexcerpt 'nuxeoctl-note' page='Installing a New Package on Your Instance'}}}

1.  Stop your server.

    ```bash
    ./nuxeoctl stop
    ```

2.  Install the package by providing the path to the downloaded .zip file.

    ```bash
    ./nuxeoctl mp-install /Users/NUXEO/Downloads/easyshare-1.1.1.zip
    ```

    The server checks possible dependencies.

    ```
