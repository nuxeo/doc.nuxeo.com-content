{{! excerpt}}
The [Nuxeo Salesforce connector](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-salesforce) covers several use cases of integration between the Nuxeo Repository and Salesforce: 
* binding a folder in Nuxeo and an object (opportunity, case, account, ...) in Salesforce, for object level document / media library
* presenting to salesforce usuers object-contextual lists of documents based on custom metadata queries
* general search across the Nuxeo repository
{{! /excerpt}}

See [GitHub Readme](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-salesforce) for the Dev project description.

## Overview
Watch [this Nuxeo University video](https://university.nuxeo.com/learn/course/external/view/elearning/221/salesforce-connector) for a functional overview.

## Installation

### Architecture

The Nuxeo Salesforce connector is made of:

- a servert part, made available as a [Nuxeo marketplace package](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-salesforce) "nuxeo-salesforce" that installs a Nuxeo Platform addon.

- a Salesforce unlocked package that installs some Salesforce lightening components and a few more Saleforce resources

### Nuxeo Marketplace package installation

The Nuxeo Marketplace Package can be found [Here](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-salesforce).
{{{multiexcerpt 'MP-installation-easy' page='Generic Multi-Excerpts'}}}

Server requirements:
- You must be on HF-34 at least to benefit from all required bugfixes for an optimal experience with the Salesforce connector. 
- You also must set sames-site cookie policy in `nuxeo.conf`:
`nuxeo.server.cookies.sameSite=none` 
- Server must always be accessed in https

### Salesforce package installation.

Prerequesites:
- You must have installed the [Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.get_started_cli) and have it authenticated against your Salesforce organization.
- Your Salesforce organization must be on Salesforce lightening. Salesforce Aurora is not supported.

The Nuxeo Salesforce package is currently made available as an [unlocked package](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_unlocked_pkg_intro.htm). Nuxeo will longer term publish it as a managed package on Salesforce marketplace. 

To install the version of the unlocked salesforce package that has been validated with the version of the Nuxeo marketplace pacakge installed on your preprod  Nuxeo server instance, using sfdx client :

`sfdx force:package:install -p 04t7R000001WYVjQAO -k nxapp@sfdc`

`04t7R000001WYVjQAO` is the version id of the salesforce package for 10.10.14 version of the Nuxeo Marketplace pacakge. We will let on the Nuxeo Pacakge description on the Nuxeo Marketplace the right Salesforce package version id to use for a given Nuxeo package version.  

### Post Installation Setup

After installing the package, you need to configure Salesforce to be able to use the Nuxeo application.

#### Define the Nuxeo Application administrators

Add the `Nuxeo_Admins` permission set to the Salesforce user(s) that are allowed to configure the Nuxeo application (user bound to sfdx authentication already has the permission set so this is an optional step):

Go to `Setup > Users`, click on the name of the target user, then go to the `Permission Sets` section to add the permission set, choose "Permission Set Assignments", then select `Nuxeo_Admins`.

This can also be done from commandline using the `sfdx force:user:permset:assign` command

#### Define the Nuxeo Application users

Add the `Nuxeo_Users` permission set to the Salesforce users allowed to use the Nuxeo application, as we expalained above. You can also use **Permission Set Groups** to easily assign permission groups to multiple users.  \
Currently, Salesforce doesn't support assigning permission sets to **Public Groups**.

#### Add the target Nuxeo domain URL to CSP Trusted Sites.

Go to `Setup > CSP Trusted Sites` and create a new **Trusted Site** using the base https URL of the target Nuxeo server - without the trailing `/nuxeo` path. Example: `https://your.nuxeo-instance.com`
Make sure to select all the sources.
Note: the CSP policy is not always taken into account immediately. To avoid some cache issues, we recommend that you log out and log in again.

#### Create a Nuxeo Connection.

As a `Nuxeo_admins` user open the **Nuxeo** tab (this tab is only visible for Nuxeo_Admins) and follow the connection setup wizard. Don't forget to set the right username / password for the cURL call.  
NB: you will need Nuxeo instance admin credentials.
You can detect a cache issue when validating your connection if you don't get the confirmation of the correct configuration. Opening the dev console you will see some errors related to content policy on CMIS endpoint

### Validate your set up

You can validate that your set up is correct by using the Nuxeo Salesforce Lightening component on a given SF object's page (ex: an Opportunity record).
- Browse an opportunity record (or create one if you have none).
- Click on "Edit page" with an admin user of the org
- On the Layout design page of the record view, drop the Nuxeo component somewhere inside the layout.
- Activate the configuration (select Desktop)
- Save
- Go back to the record screen. 

If all previous steps went ok, you should be able to click on a "Log in" button, that will open a pop up asking for authentication against the Nuxeo server if the user is not already authenticated in there. You can then drop a document in the library, it will be created in the Nuxeo repository: everything is working!

### Next steps
You will see below that there are three modes for the Nuxeo component. You can use all of the modes in various places of your salesforce application, as many time as you need. We advise you to get familiar functionnaly with the various modes and their goals reading the generic functionnal documentation,  and then to focus on configuring each components you need in regards to your business requirements, reading the configuration/ customization documentation.

## User documentation
The Nuxeo Salesforce lightening component can behave in three different ways depending on its configuration:

- **Library**: this mode exposes a content library browser with the ability for the user to drag'n drop documents and create folders.
- **Content list**: this mode exposes the result of a query in the Nuxeo repository matching the list of content required for a given business context, with an option for searching for additionnal documents to add to that list
- **Search**: this mode displays a simple search user interface to look for documents across all the Nuxeo repository, with respect to security. 

In all of those modes, user can open a given document and see many details on it. We will start by documented that "document view", and then review each of the modes to provide functionnal help on using them.

### Document view
The Nuxeo connector for Salesforce provide a way to access lists of documents, related to a search or the content of a folder. When clicking on the document title in the result, it opens a document pannel organized by tabs and with some actions bars. User can find the following areas in the document pannel:
- Document actions, all grouped on the top right of the pannel. By order:
   - *Edit with Nuxeo Drive*: displayed when user has the permission Write on the document, it allows to open the document for editing it with its native editor, like MS Word, or MS Excel. 
   - *Open in Nuxeo*: open the document in the Web UI user interface.
   - *Download*: performs a download of the main file (stored under the document property "file:content")
   - *Upload file*: available when the user has the Write permission on the document, to replace the main file (stored under the document property "file:content")
   - *Lock*:  available when the user has the Write permission on the document, allows to lock the document. See [user documentation about locking](https://doc.nuxeo.com/userdoc/content-lock/).
   - *Maximise*: maximises the document pannel, usually for having more space to previw the open content.
   - *Close*: closes the document pannel
- Preview tab: opens a the preview.
- Data tab: opens a data tab.



## Configuration / Customization

### Salesforce UI configuration

The Nuxeo Lightening Network component is available for being integrated in customized Salesforce UIs. You can drop it inside any Salesforce Lightening container component (tabs, sections, pannels, etc...). You can drop the Nuxeo component several times on the same page. You can entitle it to Saleseforce permission framework.
Once you dropped the component, you must choose the behaviour type among:

- Library: this will expose a library browser with ability to drag'n drop documents.
- Content list: this will expose the result of a query , with the ability to do a mapping between the salesfoce current record and the documents.
- Search: this will display a global search component.

You can also specify a custom configuration, see "Nuxeo Saelsforce service extension point" in the section after.

Limitation: the component cannot be activated on the Salesforce mobile view.

### Nuxeo Salesforce service extension point

The Nuxeo Salesforce connector addon deploys a new "Salesforce configuration" service in the Nuxeo Platform with an extension point that allows to contribute various configurations. When dropping the Nuxeo component on the page layout, a `configuration` attribute allows to specify a configuration (as a string). The component when being loaded queries the configured configuration to Nuxeo server, which then asks the Salesforce configuration service for the specified configuration and returns it to the Salesforce ligthening component.

This configuration object is used to configure several behaviours of the component: used pageproviders, custom salesforce properties / nuxeo properties mappings, enablement/disablement of some user actions, etc... We provide below an example of such a configuration. You can [contribute this extension from Studio](how-to-contribute-to-an-extension).

`
<extension target="org.nuxeo.salesforce.SalesforceComponent"
      point="config">
            
      <library name="my">
        <title>My Library</title>
      	<root>/default-domain/workspaces/salesforce</root>
      	<nuxeo-drive>false</nuxeo-drive>
      	<sobject type='Opportunity'>Name,Description,Amount</sobject>
      </library>
      <listing name="my">
      	<title>My Listing</title>
      	<upload>false</upload>
      	<link-operation>Salesforce.MyLink</link-operation>
      	<link-test>function(doc, recordId) { return doc.properties['dc:source'] === recordId }</link-test>
      	<nuxeo-drive>true</nuxeo-drive>
      	<sobject type='Opportunity'>Name,Description,Amount</sobject>
      	<query>
      	function(context, params) {
      		params.pageProvider = "my-second-page-provider";
      		params.customerName = context.record.Name;
      	}
      	</query>
      </listing>
      <search name="my">
      	<title>My Search</title>
        <nuxeo-drive>true</nuxeo-drive>
      	<page-provider>advanced_search</page-provider>
      </search>
      
  </extension>
