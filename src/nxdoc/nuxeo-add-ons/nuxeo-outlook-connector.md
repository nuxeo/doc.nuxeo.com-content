The Nuxeo Outlook Integration allows you to archive emails and files as documents to your Nuxeo instance and access the repository without leaving Microsoft Outlook.

**Features of the Nuxeo Outlook Integration include:**

- Archive Microsoft Outlook content (emails, meetings, and appointments) or files from the Windows file system as Nuxeo documents
- Browse and drag content from the repository to emails or your Windows desktop
Search inside your Nuxeo repository
  - As option, automatically extract email attachments to make them accessible for the search engine
- Access your favorite documents
- Create new versions and replace files of your documents
- View a documents' version history and download older versions

## Installation

### Server-side

The Nuxeo Outlook Integration Server components are packaged altogether in the handy Nuxeo package zip format.

You can use the default Nuxeo Installation guide as described in [here]({{page version='' space='nxdoc' page='installing-a-new-package-on-your-instance'}}).

#### Apply Licenses on Server

The Nuxeo Outlook Integration needs to be purchased at Nuxeo. Please contact your sales representative for further information and subscription options.

With the subscription, you will be provided with two license files
- Server license file
- Client license file
As a user with admin permissions, open the Admin Section within the Nuxeo Web UI.

![]({{file name='AdminPage.png'}} ?w=350)

Open the Outlook Integration page

**Client license**</br>
You have two option regarding the application of the client license

1. Import the client license into the server</br>
    Click the Import Client License button, select your client license file and upload it.</br>
    The license string will be displayed.

    This option is helpful, if you are using automated software rollout to your clients, as the license will be applied to each client, once the Nuxeo repository is being accessed via the Nuxeo Outlook Integration.

1. Leave the section empty and provide the client license string to your users manually.
    This option can be used if your want to control the licensed clients "manually".</br>
    The user then needs to apply the license string manually, which is described in the settings documentation of the Nuxeo Outlook Client.</br>

**Server License**
1. Click the Import Server License button.
1. Select your server License from your Explorer window and hit open to upload it.
1. Once the license is validated, you will get your license detail displayed.
1. If the license cannot be validated, an appropriate error message will be displayed instead.

#### Setting up OAuth 2

To use OAuth 2, your Nuxeo instance needs to be set up with a dedicated OAuth 2 client ID for the Outlook Integration. This can be done via REST or cURL. The client ID is configurable on client side so the name can be customized.

REST call:
**OAuth 2 add clientId to Nuxeo**
```
POST http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/api/v1/directory/oauth2Clients

POST api/v1/directory/oauth2Clients
{
"entity-type": "directoryEntry",
"directoryName": "oauth2Clients",
"properties": {
"name": "Nuxeo Outlook Integration",
"clientId": "nuxeo-oi",
"redirectURIs": "webbrowser",
"autoGrant": "true",
"enabled": "true"
}
}
```

The redirect URL is not necessary as the Outlook Integration handles the return in an embedded browser.

cURL
**OAuth2 add clientId to Nuxeo via cURL**
```
curl -u Administrator:xxxx\   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \   -X POST https://ecm-2020.cloud.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/api/v1/directory/oauth2Clients \   -d @- << EOF   {     "entity-type": "directoryEntry",     "directoryName": "oauth2Clients",     "properties": {       "name": "Nuxeo Salesforce Client",       "clientId": "nuxeo-sfdc",       "redirectURIs": "https://momentum-flow-9907-dev-ed.cs82.my.salesforce.com/apex/nuxeoauth",       "autoGrant": "true",       "enabled": "true"     }   }
```

### Client-side

#### Requirements

The Nuxeo Outlook Connector requires Windows 10 with a local installation of Office 2019 or Office 365.

#### Settings Migration From Previous Versions

When installing a newer version of the Outlook Connector, the settings file (`NuxeoClientSettings-x.x.x.xml` in the `%USERPROFILE%` folder) will be migrated to a newer version. If possible, settings will be used from the previous version. The setup will try to migrate the most recent version if there are multiple older settings files.

An administrator can force overwrite parameters from a previous installation using the "FORCEOVERWRITE" parameter from the scripted installation.

#### Manual Installation

If you are distributing the Nuxeo Outlook Client across an organization, see [Scripted Installation](#scripted-installation) section.

- Extract the contents of the archive (usually called `Nuxeo-EmailClientOutlookPlugin-x.x.x.zip`) and choose the x86 or x64 version dependent on your current system

- Choose either the `msi` or `exe` (both will work, the `msi` file is needed for the scripted installation). </br>
  An installation wizard will open.

- Follow the installation process

- Open Microsoft Outlook</br>
  You will see the Nuxeo Outlook Integration docked to the right. You can access the settings (i.e. to apply a license) by pressing the gear icon

#### Command-line Installation

This is useful for larger companies who do not want their single clients to run the installation by themselves. Besides the actual client, the installation will copy a configuration file into the user profile folder (alias in Windows Explorer: `%USERPROFILE%`). If there already is a user configuration present, the existing parameters will not be overwritten.

There are two ways client can be installed using CMD parameters:
- Interactive installation
- Quiet installation (performs in a silent mode w/o any user interaction).

In order to run an installation, you need to do the following steps:

1. Run the Command Prompt as an Administrator (even if you are an Administrator on the machine) to force all operations to be performed under administrative permissions.

1. Navigate to the folder where the `NuxeoOutlookIntegration....msi` file is located. Depending on the OS running on the client machine, you have to choose between "x86" (32 bit) or "x64" (64 bit).</br>
    Optionally you can type the exact file-path instead.

1. Execute the following command:
    - For **interactive installation**: msiexec /i NuxeoOutlookIntegration.msi LIST OF PARAMETERS (i.e. msiexec /i NuxeoOutlookIntegration.msi HOSTNAME="https://mynuxeoinstance.com/nuxeo" OAUTH2CLIENTID="nuxeo-oi")

    - For **quiet installation**: msiexec /i NuxeoOutlookIntegration.msi LIST OF PARAMETERS /quiet (i.e. msiexec /i NuxeoOutlookIntegration.msi HOSTNAME="https://mynuxeoinstance.com/nuxeo" OAUTH2CLIENTID="nuxeo-oi" /quiet)

**Command line parameters:**
- **HOSTNAME** - Sets Nuxeo server URL. (format: <http | https>://<hostname> ). The name has to point to the API endpoint, which is usually i.e. https://nuxeoserverinstance/nuxeo (but may differ on your installation).
- **OAUTH2CLIENTID** - Set the name of the OAuth2 client Id used for authentication with OAuth2
- **AUTH** - Sets the type of authentication. "Basic" or "OAuth2"
- **NUXEODRIVEENABLED** - Enables or disables the context menu for "Edit with Nuxeo Drive" - default is false
- **OFFICEONLINEENABLED** - Enables or disables the context menu for "Edit with Office Online" - default is false
- **LANGUAGE** - Sets the language (format examples: "de-DE", "fr-FR", "en-US")

Culture settings, available languages:
- en-US = English
- fr-FR = French
- de-DE = German

**Example:**
- The URL of your Nuxeo instance is "https://mynuxeoinstance.com/nuxeo".
- Authentication should be set to OAuth2, your OAuth2 client Id is `nuxeo-oi`.
- Your company has set up the Nuxeo Drive for editing but has no Office Online integration.
- You want the default language to be french (can be changed by the user later)

It should look like this:
```
msiexec /i NuxeoOutlookIntegration.msi HOSTNAME="https://mynuxeoinstance.com/nuxeo" AUTH="OAuth2" OAUTH2CLIENTID="nuxeo-mi" NUXEODRIVEENABLED="true" LANGUAGE="fr-FR"
```

If you want the same installation to run quietly, you can just add /quiet:
```
msiexec /i NuxeoOutlookIntegration.msi HOSTNAME="https://mynuxeoinstance.com/nuxeo" AUTH="OAuth2" OAUTH2CLIENTID="nuxeo-mi" NUXEODRIVEENABLED="true" LANGUAGE="fr-FR" /quiet
```

{{#> callout type='warning'}}
Once the installation is done, make sure that the [Nuxeo IMAP connector]({{page version='' space='userdoc' page='nuxeo-imap-connector'}}) has been correctly installed on your instance, as the Nuxeo Outlook connector depends on it to work correctly.
{{/callout}}

#### Settings Migration From Previous Versions

When installing a newer version of the Outlook Connector, the settings file (`NuxeoClientSettings-x.x.x.xml` in the `%USERPROFILE%` folder) will be migrated to a newer version. If possible, settings will be used from the previous version. The setup will try to migrate the most recent version if there are multiple older settings files.

An administrator can force to overwrite parameters from a previous installation using the `FORCEOVERWRITE` parameter from the scripted installation.

## Customization

Here are some templates available to customize your connector.

### Customize Document Type of Uploaded Emails

{{#> callout type='warning' }}
This feature is compatible starting from:</br>
Nuxeo Platform **LTS 2019-HF55**</br>
Nuxeo Platform **LTS 2021-HF12**/**2021.12**.
{{/callout}}

With version 1.1 of the Outlook Connector, the document type of an uploaded email can be changed from "MailMessage" to a different type by using one of the following procedures.

Make sure the new custom type extends "MailMessage" and also to create a new layout, otherwise there will be no preview, attachments or email metadata listed when opening the document in the browser.</br> Please see:

{{!--     ### nx_asset ###
    path: /default-domain/workspaces/Product Management/Documentation/Documentation Screenshots/NXDOC/Master/outlook-connector/DocumentType
    name: DocumentType.png
    addins#screenshot#up_to_date
--}}
![DocumentType](/nx_assets/3957770e-0cb8-4dd1-8d67-a813f4446194.png ?w=650,border=true)

**Create an XML Extension in Nuxeo Studio**

1. Go to your Nuxeo Studio project and go to the **XML Extensions** menu,
1. Create a new extension and set the _<type\>_ for your emails.

Here is an example:

```
<!-- Test to overwrite the standard MailMessage document type with type YourCustomDocType -->
<require>com.itnovum.outlook-connector-core.mailmessage-documenttype-contrib</require>
  <extension target="com.itnovum.outlookintegration.MailMessageDocumentTypeService" point="configuration">
      <documentType>
          <enabled>true</enabled>
          <type>YourCustomDocType</type>
      </documentType>
  </extension>
```

{{!--     ### nx_asset ###
    path: /default-domain/workspaces/Product Management/Documentation/Documentation Screenshots/NXDOC/Master/outlook-connector/mailmessage
    name: Studiocontrib.png
    addins#screenshot#up_to_date
--}}
![mailmessage](/nx_assets/40f27798-42a7-4aae-adb4-6ad4df7c0da2.png ?border=true)

**Extend Nuxeo with you own component and overwrite the service that sets the email document type (requires coding)**

First, deactivate that the document type is being loaded from the standard contribution. To do this, just add an XML extension similar to the one above but set the _<enabled\>_ tag to `false`.

```
<!-- Test to overwrite the standard MailMessage document type with type File -->
<require>com.itnovum.outlook-connector-core.mailmessage-documenttype-contrib</require>
<extension target="com.itnovum.outlookintegration.MailMessageDocumentTypeService" point="configuration">
	<documentType>
		<enabled>false</enabled>
		<type>MailMessage</type>
	</documentType>
</extension>
```

After being disabled, the implementation will now use the service implementation. If no override is found, the standard implementation will be used and return "MailMessage".

For a custom service implementation and how to override existing ones, please refer to the Nuxeo [documentation]({{page version='' space='nxdoc' page='how-to-create-a-service'}})

### Customize Metadata Display

**Description**

To show metadata in Outlook, the Nuxeo Outlook Connector uses template rendering on the backend side. The Outlook Connector client then receives an HTML representation of the metadata and displays it to the user.

The templates depend on the document type. Currently there are two different templates in the Outlook Connector package, one default template which will be used if no special template is defined for requested document type and one template for type "MailMessage". The default template renders common properties which are provided by every document type. The "MailMessage" template provides special properties of the MailMessage document type.

If you want to create an additional template you have to use following naming format:
```
 "outlook-" + docType + "-metadata".ftl
```
So for example the template name for MailMessage should be:
```
outlook-MailMessage-metadata.ftl
```

A new template can be added either through a Nuxeo package or Nuxeo Studio. In Nuxeo Studio you have to add it to Templates/Document Templates.

Use this example to add the template through a Nuxeo package as extension:
```
  <extension target="org.nuxeo.runtime.services.resource.ResourceService" point="resources">
    <resource name="outlook-basic-metadata">OSGI-INF/outlook-DocType1-metadata.ftl</resource>
    <resource name="outlook-MailMessage-metadata">OSGI-INF/outlook-DocType2-metadata.ftl</resource>
    ...
  </extension>
```

**Template example**
```
<#assign
LANG = Context.OUTLOOKCONNECT_LANG

_title = This['dc:title']
_modified = This['dc:modified']

_sender = This['mail:sender']
_subject = This['dc:title']
_sending_date = This['mail:sending_date']

If you want to use translations, the message files have to be added to the Nuxeo server.

**API**

To retrieve the rendered template from the backend, use following API end point:
```
api/v1/automation/OutlookConnect.RenderMetadata
```

Additional parameters have to be passed with the request:
```
{"params":{"DocType ":"DOC_TYPE","Lang":"LANGUAGE"},"input":"UID"}
```

The default language is English.

### Translate column headers

For Outlook Connector v1.3 and above it is possible to translate the column headers. This requires a Nuxeo Studio connection and and a minor amount of work for the administrator.

First, go to the Nuxeo Studio instance connected to your server. Switch to the Designer mode and expand the "Translations". If no "messages" file is present, use the "+"-Button to create a file for your preferred language. Use the following naming pattern.

Standard file: "messages"
French: "messages-fr-FR"
German: "messages-de-DE"
Spanish: "messages-es-ES"
Italian: "messages-it-IT"
Dutch: "messages-nl-NL"
Swedish: "messages-sv-SE"
Japanes: "messages-ja-JP"
Please add the following labels and their preferred translation. Example for French:

{
  "label.oi.title": "Titre",
  "label.oi.modified": "Modification",
  "label.oi.version": "Version",
  "label.oi.lastcontributor": "Dernier contributeur",
  "label.oi.created": "Création",
  "label.oi.creator": "Contributeur",
  "label.oi.coverage": "Couverture",
  "label.oi.nature": "Nature",
  "label.oi.subjects": "Sujets"
}
Save the file, update the project in your servers' update center. After the next restart, the translations will be available for the client to use.

The Connector will always try to find the translation file for the language selected in the "General" settings:

{{!--     ### nx_asset ###
    path: /default-domain/workspaces/Product Management/Documentation/Documentation Screenshots/NXDOC/Master/outlook-connector/Language
    name: 521044021.png
    addins#screenshot#up_to_date
--}}
![Language](/nx_assets/ed4c5fbe-aa12-44c6-9b0e-5d6aac8843c9.png ?w=650,border=true)

If no translation file is present it will fallback to the "messages" file. If this is also not present, it will fallback to the standard naming saved in the client itself.
