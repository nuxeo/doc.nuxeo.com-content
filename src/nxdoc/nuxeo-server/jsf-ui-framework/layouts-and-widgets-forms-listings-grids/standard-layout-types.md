{{! excerpt}}
Some layout types have been extracted to ease up defining layouts.
{{! /excerpt}}

## listingTable

This layout type defines templates to use for the `view`, `csv`, `pdf` modes, as well as additional modes for selected columns edition, and sort infos edition, depending on configuration held by the layout definition.

### Global properties

The following properties can be set directly on the layout definition, for a specific mode or for any mode:

-   `showListingHeader`: this boolean property controls the rendering of the listing table header, defaults to true.
-   `showRowEvenOddClass`: this boolean property controls addition of a style class to highlight row and even classes, defaults to true.

### Row or Column properties

-   `columnStyleClass`: this property can be used to control style class of a given column.
-   `useFirstWidgetLabelAsColumnHeader`: this boolean property controls display of the first widget label as column header.
-   `sortPropertyName`: this property controls the property that will be used to handle sorting when clicking on the column header.
-   `label`: this property controls the label that will be used for this column when selecting it for column display or sort information definition.
-   `isListingSelectionBox` or `isListingSelectionBoxWithCurrentDocument`: this property controls the display of the global "select all/unselect all" header checkbox or action.&nbsp; The "WithCurrentDocument" property should be preferably used when listing is displayed on a page where the current document should be available.
-   `isHidden`:&nbsp; this property is useful for the pdf and csv modes, when a column does not need to be presented in this cases (typically the selection checkbox).
-   `showInSortInfoSelection`: this property controls the availability of the corresponding sort property when defining sort infos to apply in a filtering form. It is checked in modes `edit_sort_infos` and `edit_sort_infos_map` only.

## listingThumbnail

This layout type defines templates to use for the `view`, `csv`, `pdf` modes, as well as additional modes for selected columns edition, and sort infos edition, depending on configuration held by the layout definition.

A first layout (with corresponding selection checkbox as well as document title and thumbnail is displayed), additional column/rows configuration are piled up in the box, under the thumbnail.

### Global Properties

The following property can be set directly on the layout definition, for a specific mode or for any mode:

-   `thumbnailHeaderLayout`: this property controls the layout to be displayed in the thumbnail, defaults to layout `listing_thumbnail_header`.

### Row or Column Properties

-   `isBoxTitle`: this boolean property controls the display of a specific style class to highlight corresponding widgets in the box.
