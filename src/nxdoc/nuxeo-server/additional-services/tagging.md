The tags are either categorizing the content of the document (labels like `document_management`, `ECM`, `complex_Web_application`, etc., can be thought as tags for Nuxeo), or they reflect the user feeling (`great`, `user_friendly`, `versatile`, etc.).

{{! excerpt}}

The tag service uses a [facet]({{page page='available-facets'}}) to represent tags as a document property.

{{! /excerpt}}

A tagging action is a link between a given document and a tag, and belongs to a given user.
A tag holds a label that does not contain any:
- space
- slash
- backslash
- percent
- quote

{{#> callout type='info' }}

Since 10.3, if using the service based on the `NXTag` facet, it is possible to use these characters except the percent when creating tags. 
This can be enabled or disabled with the following configuration property: `nuxeo.tag.sanitization.enabled`.
By default they are not usable (`nuxeo.tag.sanitization.enabled=true`).

{{/callout}}

Characters will be removed by service.

## Functional Overview

{{{multiexcerpt 'functional-overview' page='USERDOC:Tags'}}}

## Tag Service Features

The tag service is accessed through the  [`TagService`](http://community.nuxeo.com/api/nuxeo/latest/javadoc/org/nuxeo/ecm/platform/tag/TagService.html)  interface.

The tag service allows you to:

*   Tag and untag a document
*   Get all the tags for a document
*   Get all the documents for a tag
*   Get suggested tags for a given tag prefix

## Tags, Versions and Proxies

The tags are duplicated:

*   From the live document when creating a version
*   From a version when creating a proxy

When restoring a version, the tags on the live document are also restored from the ones on the version.

Tags can be added and removed independently on live documents and versions: a tag added on a live document won't be added on all its versions, but only on the versions that will be created after.

The logic for the above is in the  [`TaggedVersionListener`](http://community.nuxeo.com/api/nuxeo/latest/javadoc/org/nuxeo/ecm/platform/tag/TaggedVersionListener.html) listener.

### Disabling Tags on Versions

To disable the duplication of tags on versions and proxies, the `TaggedVersionListener` may be disabled with the following contribution:

```xml
<require>org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.tag.service.listener</require>
<extension target="org.nuxeo.ecm.core.event.EventServiceComponent" point="listener">
  <listener name="taggedVersionListener" enabled="false" />
</extension>
```
## Tag Service Architecture

 {{#> callout type='warning' }}
 Since 9.3, the tag service uses the `NXTag` facet. The following paragraph describes the previous tag service architecture that is deprecated since 9.3.
 {{/callout}}

The following document types are defined by the tag service.

A `Tag` is a document type representing the tag itself (but not its association to specific documents). It contains the usual `dublincore` schema, and in addition has a specific `tag` schema containing a `tag:label` string field.

A `Tagging` is a relation type representing the action of tagging a given document with a tag. (A relation type is a document type extending the default `Relation` document type; it works like a normal document type except that it's not found by NXQL queries on `Document`). The important fields of a `Tagging` document are `relation:source` which is the document id, `relation:target` which is the tag id, and `dc:creator` which is the user doing the tagging action.

Both `Tag` and `Tagging` documents managed by the tag service are _unfiled_, which means that they don't have a parent folder. They are therefore not visible in the normal tree of documents; only queries can find them. In addition they don't have any ACLs set on them, which means that only a superuser (and the tag service internal code) can access them.
