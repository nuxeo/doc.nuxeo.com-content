{{#> callout type='warning' }}
While installing hotfixes, you will see the following message, but you can ignore it and continue.  
```
Use of the <copy /> command on JAR files is not recommended, prefer using <update /> command to ensure a safe rollback. (nuxeo-launcher-9.10-HF01-jar-with-dependencies.jar)
```

## Instance Registration

Hotfixes released for LTS 2019 can only be used on valid, registered Nuxeo instances.

**Why?** </br>
If you are using an *unregistered LTS 2019 Nuxeo instance with hotfixes installed*, you may encounter the following behavior:
- A warning will be displayed in the logs during startup,

```
ERROR [RuntimeService] NUXEO INSTANCE NOT REGISTERED

***** This Nuxeo instance is not registered *****
It can only be used for development and will be stopped if used in production
```
- Over a certain level of use the server will be stopped automatically. When this happens, a message is displayed in the logs to inform you as well.

```
ERROR [RuntimeService] NUXEO INSTANCE STOPPING

***** This Nuxeo instance is not registered *****
Stopping Nuxeo instance due to threshold exceeded (TOTAL_COMMITS > 100000) after failed registration checks
```
The current limits of use are:
- 100,000 transaction commits
- 10 concurrent sessions (a session correspond to an access to the core)

If the expiration date is close (less than 15 days), a warning will be displayed and indicate how many days are left before expiration.
In the JSF UI, a message based on the Administrative message mechanism will be displayed: all users will be informed.

After expiration date, the following message will be displayed in the logs at startup:
```
ERROR [RuntimeService] NUXEO INSTANCE REGISTRATION EXPIRED

***** This Nuxeo instance registration is expired *****
It can only be used for development and will be stopped if used in production
```

The following message will be displayed in the logs when Nuxeo will be stopped automatically according to the same conditions as described earlier:
```
ERROR [RuntimeService] NUXEO INSTANCE STOPPING

***** This Nuxeo instance registration is expired *****
Stopping Nuxeo instance due to threshold exceeded (TOTAL_COMMITS > 100000) after registration expiration
```

**How Can I Avoid This?** </br>

Make sure to [register your Nuxeo instance]({{page version='810' space='nxdoc' page='registering-your-nuxeo-instance'}}): this can be done both for online and offline instances.

**Could it Break My CI Chain? Do I Need to Register My Test Instances?** </br>

The level of use needed  to stop an *unregistered instance with hotfixes* has been tuned to prevent any problems with CI chain tests. It would be possible to run the full test suite of Nuxeo server (both unit tests AND integration tests) several times before anything would happen.

Nevertheless, it is recommended to register your test instances, especially if you wish to test features that require heavy usage (e.g. load testing or mass import).

**How Often Do I Need to Register My Instance?** </br>

{{#> callout type='warning' }}
Registration tokens are valid until your current contract's expiration date. When renewing your Nuxeo Online Services subscription, you should register your instances again.

## Hotfix 02

### Multiple AWS Configuration

AWS configuration can now specify an id with:
```
  <extension target="org.nuxeo.runtime.aws.AWSConfigurationService" point="configuration">
    <configuration id="myconfig">
      <accessKeyId>MY_ACCESS_KEY_ID</accessKeyId>
      <secretKey>MY_SECRET_KEY</secretKey>
      <region>MY_REGION</region>
    </configuration>
  </extension> 
```
If the id is not specified, default is used.

To get to this configuration, one can then use:
```
new NuxeoAWSCredentialsProvider(id)
new NuxeoAWSRegionProvider(id).getRegion()
```
Note that if the configuration is not found, the providers will still fall back on the default AWS SDK behavior to look in the OS environment, Java system properties, AWS profile or EC2 container credentials (which don't take into account any configuration id).


### S3 Server-side Encryption

S3 copy (used during direct upload in particular) now correctly takes into account the server-side encryption configuration for the destination bucket.

For direct upload, this requires setting the property:
```
nuxeo.s3storage.transient.crypt.serverside=true
```

### S3 Multipart Part Size

There is a new configuration property `nuxeo.s3.multipart.copy.part.size` to change the S3 multipart copy part size. The default is `5242880` (5MB). </br>

It can be changed with:
```
  <extension target="org.nuxeo.runtime.ConfigurationService" point="configuration">
    <property name="nuxeo.s3.multipart.copy.part.size">5242880</property>
  </extension>
```
