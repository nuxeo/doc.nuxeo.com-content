Like any other Java application, Nuxeo can be profiled, you will find a few useful tools in this section.

## Java Flight Recorder (JFR)

With OpenJDK version 17, it is easy to run Flight Recorder.
JFR is a profiling tool used to gather diagnostics and profiling data from a running Java application.

To observe a particular load during one minute on a Nuxeo node just run:

```bash
jcmd Boot JFR.start duration=60s filename=/tmp/capture.jfr
```

This will produce a JFR file `/tmp/capture.jfr`.

You now need to install [Zulu Mission Control](https://www.azul.com/products/zulu-mission-control/) and open the JFR file.

This is a very powerful way to report a performance problem because in addition of the profiling,
the JFR file also contains a capture of the CPU activity, memory pressure, and thread dumps.

## Java Flame Graph

[Flame graph](http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html) are a visualization of profiled software,
allowing the most frequent code-paths to be identified quickly and accurately.

A typical output is an SVG that can be searched and zoomed:
![flame graph]({{file name='profiling-flame-graph.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)

First follow the documentation to [install Async profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler).

Then add this to your `nuxeo.conf`:
```bash
JAVA_OPTS=$JAVA_OPTS -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+DebugNonSafepoints
```

Proceed to profiling with different flavors:

If you see a CPU saturation:
```bash
./profiler.sh -d 30 --title "Nuxeo CPU" -f /tmp/flame-cpu.svg jps
```

If there is no particular CPU saturation try:
```bash
./profiler.sh -e wall -t -d 30 --title "Nuxeo off-cpu" -f /tmp/flame-off-cpu.svg jps
```
Or better, filtering only interesting threads:
```bash
./profiler.sh -e wall -t -d 30 --title "Nuxeo off-cpu" -I work/* -I bulk/* -I http-nio-* -I retention/* -I audit/* -I stream/* -f /tmp/flame-off-cpu.svg jps
```

If you see memory pressure:
```bash
./profiler.sh -e alloc -d 30 --title '"Nuxeo Memory"' -f /tmp/flame-mem.svg jps
```
