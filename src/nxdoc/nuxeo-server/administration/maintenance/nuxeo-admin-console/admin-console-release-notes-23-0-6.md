## Whatâ€™s New in Admin Console for LTS 2023 (Version 23.0.6)

### Hyland UI replaced by Angular Material

- Hyland UI is removed from Admin Console, following it's deprecation, with the interface now using plain Angular Material while maintaining a consistent design.

### Fulltext Reindexing Support

- User can run extraction of all binaries (blobs) referenced by documents using fulltext reindex of 

  - a single document.

  - a document and all of it's children.

  - documents returned by a NXQL query.

- A confirmation popup shows the number of documents affected, estimated reindex time, and potential performance impact, prompting users to continue or abort.
