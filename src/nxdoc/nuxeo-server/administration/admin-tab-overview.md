{{{multiexcerpt 'JSF-UI-required' page='generic-multi-excerpts'}}}

The Admin tab, also called Admin Center, is a space within the Nuxeo Platform that provides administrative services, such as server and application usage summary information, as well as access to upgrades, patches, the Nuxeo Marketplace, and Nuxeo Studio projects. It is available to administrators and power users. Power users have access to a limited set of admin features.

The Admin tab offers access to different kinds of information about your Nuxeo instance. Depending the addons you have installed on the Platform, you may have more or less information, i.e. more or less tabs.

{{#> callout type='info' }}
Installing Nuxeo Packages can add new tabs in the Admin tab. In that case, the new Admin tab feature is described in the addon's documentation.
{{/callout}}

The default tabs available in the Admin tab are listed below. These tabs are available whatever the modules or addons you installed on the Platform.

## System Information

This section of the Admin tab provides information about the server the Nuxeo Platform is installed on, about your instance configuration.

![]({{file name='AdminCenter_SetupTab.png'}} ?w=650)

The different sub-tabs are:

- **Host**: Provides information about the computer on which the Nuxeo Platform is installed. This is also where you can easily restart Nuxeo, using the **Restart server** button.
- **Nuxeo Distribution**: Provides information on the Nuxeo distribution you are using, its name, version, build time, ... and all the Nuxeo bundles currently deployed.
- **Setup**: Enables you to change your application's configuration, such as where the logs are stored, or the default port. Some examples are available on the&nbsp;[Setup Best Practices]({{page page='setup-best-practices'}}) page. This tab enables you to perform the same configuration modification as you can do manually by editing the [nuxeo.conf file]({{page page='configuration-parameters-index-nuxeoconf'}}).
- **Repository Statistics**: Provides some statistics about the content of your application (how many documents, how many versions, size of the biggest folder...).
- **Repository Binaries**: Computes statistics on the binaries and enables you to delete the unused ones (deleted from the UI but still stored on the server).

## Activity

This section of the Admin tab enables administrators to have information and statistics on how the application is used.

![]({{file name='Admin-Center-Activity-tab.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)

The default Activity subtabs are:

- **Users Sessions**: Provides information on who is logged in to the Platform.
  {{{multiexcerpt 'users-sessions-tab-details' page='Metrics and Monitoring'}}}
- **Events**: Lists the events that occurred on the platform. You can filter this list to only get the events from a specific user or only events from a specific category.
- **Background work**: Provides information on the asynchronous tasks performed by the Work Manager. For each work category there is a queue reporting 3 metrics: the number of works waiting for execution, the number of works currently running and the number of works completed.</br>
  For instance 'Queue videoConversion (2/4/6)' means that 2 videos are waiting to be converted, 4 videos conversions are in progress and 6 has been converted.
- **Repository Analytics**: Provides statistics on the repository. You can filter these statistics on a specific time period.
- **Search Analytics**: Provides statistics on the queries done by users and how search filters are used.

## Nuxeo Online Services

You can connect your Nuxeo instance with your [Nuxeo Online Services](http://www.nuxeo.com/services/support/) account. This enables you to get a summary of your Nuxeo Online Services registration, and to register your Nuxeo Platform if you haven't done it yet.

![]({{file name='Admin-Center-Connect.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)

- The **Nuxeo Online Services Registration Status** tab is where you can register your instance. When you have already registered, it displays your contract and instance information.
- The **Nuxeo Support Tickets** tab will display the list of JIRA issues linked to your contract. This feature is not yet available, but you can see all your JIRA issues from the [Nuxeo Connect dashboard](http://connect.nuxeo.com).

## Monitoring

This section of the Admin tab enables administrators to monitor some technical information and display messages to users.

![]({{file name='Admin-Center-monitoring.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)

- The **Administrative Statuses** tab is the place from which you can display messages to the application's users, make the application unavailable or to make SMTP services unavailable.
- The **Probes** tab enables you to check the access to the SQL repositories, LDAP directory and the local Nuxeo instance.
- The **Nuxeo Event Bus** displays statistics about the processing of listeners.
- The **Shell** tab enables users to use the [Nuxeo Shell]({{page page='nuxeo-shell'}}).
- The **Logs** tab displays the content of the server log files. You can also download the full log files.
  Note: If the Nuxeo clustering configuration is enabled, only the logs of the node you are connected to will be displayed.

## Cloud Services

This section of the Admin tab enables administrators to manage the authentication with other applications using OAuth protocol.

![]({{file name='AdminCenter-OAuth-tab.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)

- The **Server Key** tabs shows the Nuxeo certificate that is required by other applications.
- The **Services Providers** and **Services Providers Tokens** tabs enable to declare external applications to which the Nuxeo Platform will connect.
- The **Consumers** and **Consumers Tokens** tabs enable to declare external applications that will connect to the Nuxeo Platform.
