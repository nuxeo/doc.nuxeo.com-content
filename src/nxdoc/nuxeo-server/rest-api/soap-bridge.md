## JAX-WS Bindings

&nbsp;

{{! excerpt}}

The Nuxeo Platform includes a JAX-WS compliant implementation to expose SOAP based web services. Apache CXF is used.

{{! /excerpt}}

As explained earlier in these pages, JAX-WS is not the preferred way to expose web services on top of Nuxeo Platform. This is the reason why the default distributions don't expose a lot of SOAP based web services. By default, the exposed SOAP web services include:

*   A read only access to the Document Repository and the User Manager (NuxeoRemoting),
*   A read only access to the Audit trail (NuxeoAudit),
*   The CMIS bindings.

If you want to access the SOAP web service:

*   To list all the deployed endpoints:

    *   `http://server:port/nuxeo/webservices/nuxeoremoting` to list all the deployed endpoints,
*   To access NuxeoRemoting WSDL: `http://server:port/nuxeo/webservices/nuxeoremoting?wsdl,`
*   To access NuxeoAudit WSDL: `http://server:port/nuxeo/webservices/nuxeoaudit?wsdl`.

The point of SOAP web services is not to have a 1 to 1 mapping with the Java services interfaces. The goal is to provide a "coarse grained" high level API. So it's easy to build new SOAP based web services on top of Nuxeo:

*   The JAX-WS infrastructure is already there,
*   The authentication system is already in place,
*   We provide the base class to manage Repository and security (AbstractNuxeoWebService),
*   We already provide JAXB objects for Documents, Security descriptors, properties ...

You can find a step-by-step example on the page [Building a SOAP-Based WebService in the Nuxeo Platform]({{page page='building-a-soap-based-webservice-in-the-nuxeo-platform'}}).

You might also want to build a **web service client** in Nuxeo to be able to query a remote web service. A simple example is available on the page [Building a SOAP-Based WebService Client in Nuxeo]({{page page='building-a-soap-based-webservice-client-in-nuxeo'}}).
