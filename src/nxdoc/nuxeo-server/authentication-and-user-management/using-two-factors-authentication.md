You can make your Nuxeo Platform instance use services of [DuoWeb](https://www.duosecurity.com/) for benefiting from a two factors authentication (like receiving a code by SMS in addition to putting the login/ password). See the [dedicated addon page]({{page page='nuxeo-duoweb-two-factor-authentication'}}) for usage and installation instructions.
