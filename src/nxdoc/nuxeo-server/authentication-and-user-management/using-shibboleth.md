The Nuxeo Platform can be made compatible with Shibboleth IdP for authentication by installing the [Shibboleth Nuxeo package](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/shibboleth-authentication), and by adding `SHIB_AUTH` in the authentication chain, as illustrated at the beginning of this section. Read the [Shibboleth configuration detailed instructions]({{page page='shibboleth-authentication'}}).
