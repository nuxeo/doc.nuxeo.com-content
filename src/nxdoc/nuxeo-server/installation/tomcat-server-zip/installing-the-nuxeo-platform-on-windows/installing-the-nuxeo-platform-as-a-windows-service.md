Installing Nuxeo as a Windows service is independent of Nuxeo Multiple solutions are available, here are some of them, given without any warranty.


{{#> callout type='tip' }}

Once a batch is installed as a service, it cannot be changed: you must first uninstall it, then edit and reinstall in order to change its content.
So, it's generally a good idea to write a batch file wrapping calls to `nuxeoctl.bat` and install that `NuxeoWrapper.bat` as a service, which will be responsible of starting Nuxeo with the wanted user and environment parameters.

{{/callout}}

## Prerequisites

In order to run as a service, you have to manage the directory rights for the super-user running the service. There are behavior changes depending on the Windows version.

Also, take care that network directories are usually not available when a service is executing. So, if you need to use some, you will have to mount them in the batch script before starting the Nuxeo Platform.

The database used by the Nuxeo Platform has to be installed as a service and started before the Nuxeo service.

## Available Solutions

### NSSM - Non-Sucking Service Manager (Experimental)

[NSSM](https://nssm.cc/) is a Windows service helper that makes it much more easy to launch any type of application as a service. What is more, it also handles failure, by relaunching applications whenever they exit prematurely. Here are the instructions to install Nuxeo as a Windows service using NSSM:

1.  Download NSSM from [the official website](https://nssm.cc/download) or install it via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), by typing: `choco install nssm`
2.  If NSSM was installed via Chocolatey, skip this step. Otherwise, add NSSM's location to PATH.
3.  Install Nuxeo as a service, by running on an elevated console or powershell: `nssm install Nuxeo "<absolute-path-to-nuxeoctl.bat>" --gui false console`

From now on, Nuxeo will start as a service whenever Windows starts. The `console` parameter allows the process to stay alive after the server starts, thus preventing NSSM from restarting it.

This seems to be the easiest solution so far, but thorough testing is yet to be performed.

### Yet Another Java Service Wrapper (Recommended)

[YAJSW](http://yajsw.sourceforge.net/) is a Java centric implementation of the [Java Service Wrapper by tanuki](http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/) (JSW). It aims at being mostly configuration compliant with the original. YAJSW is LGPL licensed. That solution seems to be the more flexible, robust and multi-OS compliant.

{{#> callout type='note' }}

When using this solution it is important that Nuxeo installation path contains no space (typically NOT `C:\Program Files\nuxeo`). Otherwise the service wrapper will truncate the path after the space and the service will not start. <span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">It is recommended that Nuxeo is installed at the root of the volume (`C:\nuxeo\` for instance).</span>

{{/callout}}

#### Installing Nuxeo as a Windows Service Using YAJSW

1.  [Download the latest stable version of YAJSW](http://sourceforge.net/projects/yajsw/files/) and unzip the archive.
2.  Set the system environment variable `NUXEO_CONF` to the location of your `nuxeo.conf` file, something like `%NUXEO_HOME%\bin\nuxeo.conf`.
3.  Start the Nuxeo Platform from the command line:

    ```
    nuxeoctl.bat --gui=false start
    ```

    Once the server is started, you'll get a message like below where XXXX is the process ID of the running Nuxeo application:

    ```
    Server started with process ID XXXX.
    ```

4.  Start a Command Prompt as an Administrator.
5.  Go to the `%YAJSW_HOME%\bat` folder.
6.  Execute the `genConfig`command with the process ID as parameter:

    ```
    genConfig.bat XXXX
    ```

    The configuration is written in the file `%YAJSW_HOME%\conf\wrapper.conf`.

    {{#> callout type='note' heading='Wrapper Static Configuration Vs nuxeo.conf'}}

    Once the wrapper configuration is generated, it is static. It means any further start of the Nuxeo service won't read [nuxeo.conf]({{page page='configuration-parameters-index-nuxeoconf'}}) to apply configuration changes.

    If you edit `nuxeo.conf` after having installed Nuxeo as a service, there are two possibilities:

    *   Your changes are only about the configuration of Nuxeo: you only need to restart Nuxeo one time with its own launcher (step 3).
    *   Your changes are about JVM options (changes in `JAVA_OPTS` variable: memory, debug ...): you'll have to start Nuxeo with its launcher and generate the new wrapper configuration (step 3 to 6).

    In both cases, you don't have to unregister the service and register it again: the wrapper will use the same configuration file (`wrapper.conf`).

    {{/callout}}
7.  Stop the Nuxeo Platform.

    ```
    nuxeoctl.bat --gui=false stop
    ```

8.  Open the `wrapper.conf` file:
    - at the end of the file, add a new line among the additional java options to set the `nuxeo.home` environment property. In the example below, Nuxeo is installed in `E:\Nuxeo` and the new line is the 10th wrapper additional option:

    ```
    wrapper.java.additional.10 = -Dnuxeo.home=E:\\\\Applis\\\\Nuxeo
    ```
    - make sure the `wrapper.console.title` entry does not contain a colon (":") or the `runConsole.bat` execution will fail. In that case, remove the colon or set another title.
9.  Execute your wrapped application as a console application:

    ```
    runConsole.bat
    ```

10.  Check your application is accessible.
11.  Edit the file `%YAJSW_HOME%\conf\wrapper.conf`

    1.  set your custom values for these parameters:

        ```
        # Name of the service
        wrapper.ntservice.name=NuxeoPlatform
        # Display name of the service
        wrapper.ntservice.displayname=Nuxeo Platform
        # Description of the service
        wrapper.ntservice.description=Service to manage the Nuxeo Platform

        wrapper.control = APPLICATION 
        ```

    2.  If set, remove or comment the following `wrapper.on_exit` parameters:

        ```
        #wrapper.on_exit.0=SHUTDOWN
        #wrapper.on_exit.default=RESTART
        ```

        {{#> callout type='warning' }}

        With the two above values set, the service would restart every time a server error occurs.

        {{/callout}}
12.  Install the application as a service:

    ```
    installService.bat
    ```

    Your service is installed and you can run the Nuxeo Platform from its service ("Windows Computer Management > Services" on Windows 7).

### JBoss Native Windows (aka JBossSVC, JBossService and JavaService)

Deprecated Nuxeo scripts managing install as a Windows service were previously used. They were based on [JBoss Native Windows](http://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossNativeWindows) which is now not recommended because of a number of defects. However, it was relatively easy to use and provides a quick solution.

As an example, here is the content of `jboss-native-2.0.4/bin/service.bat`:

Other implementations were available from JBoss.

{{#> callout type='note' }}

They were licensed under LGPL and so redistributable but there are not fully satisfying.

{{/callout}}

### JavaServiceWrapper by Tanuki

Tanuki's library provides [multiple methods for integrating a software as a service on various OS](http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/doc/english/integrate.html), the easier is to use the WrapperSimpleApp helper class to launch the application: see [the example of JBoss installed as a Windows service](http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/doc/english/integrate-simple-win.html).
It requires to unzip the downloaded wrapper file, configure a `wrapper.conf` file pointing to `%NUXEO_HOME%\bin\nuxeoctl.bat`, then write a `wrapper.bat` file for managing test/install/uninstall:

{{#> panel type='code' heading='JavaServiceWrapper usage'}}

```
REM Test:
wrapper.exe -c %NUXEO_HOME%\wrapper\wrapper.conf

REM Install:
wrapper.exe -i %NUXEO_HOME%\wrapper\wrapper.conf

REM Uninstall:
wrapper.exe -r %NUXEO_HOME%\wrapper\wrapper.conf
```

{{/panel}}

This solution is known to work well but is sadly not redistributable for us because of its GPL/Commercial license.

### Tomcat Service Install/Uninstall Script (deprecated)

Previous versions of the Tomcat distribution of Nuxeo came with a `service.bat` script in the `bin` directory that could be adapted to install Nuxeo as a Windows service.

### .NET InstallUtil (deprecated)

.NET framework provides an `InstallUtil.exe` tool for installing/uninstalling services.

{{#> panel type='code' heading='InstallUtil usage'}}

```
REM Install
InstallUtil /i %NUXEO_HOME\bin\service.bat

REM Uninstall
InstallUtil /u %NUXEO_HOME\bin\service.bat

```

There are some disadvantages such as failures in case of multiple frameworks installed and frontward/backward incompatibilities.
