On this page, you will see how to start and stop your Nuxeo application installed from the Tomcat ZIP server.

The Nuxeo Platform comes with a Control Panel that allows you to start and stop the server easily, and to access more administration features.

![]({{file name='Nuxeo_Control_Panel.png'}} ?w=300)

The Control Panel gives you access to:

- A summary of the server status: is it running, is stopped, etc...
- The logs of the server: the console and server logs are information of the tasks the server is doing and messages on how it is processing these tasks.
- The [Nuxeo Shell]({{page page='nuxeo-shell'}}): the administrators' Swiss Army knife.

## Starting Your Nuxeo Application

### Linux {{> anchor 'start-linux'}}

Nuxeo applications are started using scripts.

1. Launch a terminal and go to your installation directory.
1. Start the server using the `nuxeoctl` script (located in the `bin` directory):

  ```shell
  ./bin/nuxeoctl start --gui true
  ```

  {{#> callout type='tip' }}

  The command used to launch the Control Panel may not be executable by default. If it is the case, in the terminal go to the `bin` directory of uxeo and type the line below to be able to use it:

  ```shell
  chmod +x *.sh *ctl
  ```

  {{/callout}}

  The Control Panel opens.

1. Click on the **Start** button.
   Starting the Nuxeo server takes between 30 sec and several minutes, depending on your hardware.
   When the server is started, the **Start** button becomes a **Stop** button.
1. Open a browser and type the URL `http://NUXEO_SERVER/nuxeo/`.
   The login page is displayed so you can use the application.

### macOS {{> anchor 'start-macos'}}

#### Using the Control Panel

1. From the Finder, click on `Start Nuxeo.command`.
   You can also drag and drop the start script in the terminal and press Enter.

  {{#> callout type='tip' }}

  The command may not be executable by default. If it is the case, in the terminal go to the `bin` directory of Nuxeo and type the line below:

  ```shell
  chmod +x *.command
  ```

  {{/callout}}

  The Control Panel opens and the server starts.
  Starting the Nuxeo server takes between 30 sec and several minutes, depending on your hardware.
  When the server is started, the **Start** button becomes a **Stop** button.

1. Open a browser and type the URL `http://NUXEO_SERVER/nuxeo/`.
   The login page is displayed so you can use the application.

#### Using the nuxeoctl Script

1. Open a terminal and go to the&nbsp;`/bin` directory of your Nuxeo application.

  ```shell
  cd $NUXEO_HOME/bin
  ```

1. Execute the&nbsp;`nuxeoctl` script with the&nbsp;`start` command.

  ```shell
  ./nuxeoctl start --gui true
  ```

  The Control Panel opens and the server starts.
  Check out the page [nuxeoctl and Control Panel Usage]({{page page='nuxeoctl-and-control-panel-usage'}}) for more commands and options of the nuxeoctl` script, like the `console` command.

### Windows {{> anchor 'start-windows'}}

#### Using the Control Panel

1. Open the Nuxeo Control Panel:
    - In the folder `C:\Nuxeo application`, double-click on `Start Nuxeo.bat`.
    - In the folder `C:\Nuxeo application\bin\`, double-click on `nuxeoctl.bat`.The Nuxeo Control Panel opens and the server starts.
    Starting the Nuxeo server takes between a few seconds and several minutes, depending on your hardware.
    When the server is started, the **Start** button becomes a **Stop** button.
2. Open a browser and type the URL `http://NUXEO_SERVER/nuxeo/`.
   The login page is displayed so you can use the application.

{{! multiexcerpt name='infos_windows'}} {{#> callout type='info' }}

On Windows 7 (and higher versions), you need to run the `nuxeoctl.bat` and `Start Nuxeo.bat` commands as an administrator if you haven't installed your Nuxeo application at the root of `C:\` (for instance in `C:\Program Files`). To run them as an administrator, right-click on the command and click on "Run as administrator".

{{/callout}}

On Windows, it is possible to start Nuxeo as a service. Please report the [Installing the Nuxeo Platform as a Windows Service]({{page page='installing-the-nuxeo-platform-as-a-windows-service'}}) page for guidelines and examples.

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

#### Using the nuxeoctl Script

1. Launch a command prompt and go to the `/bin` directory of your Nuxeo application.

  ```shell
  cd %NUXEO_HOME%/bin
  ```

1. Execute the `nuxeoctl.bat` script with the `start` command.

  ```shell
  nuxeoctl.bat start
  ```

  The Control Panel opens and the server starts.
  Check out the page [nuxeoctl and Control Panel Usage]({{page page='nuxeoctl-and-control-panel-usage'}}) for more commands and options of the `nuxeoctl` script, like the `console` command.

## Stopping Your Nuxeo Application

The steps to stop your Nuxeo application are the same for all operating systems.

### Using the Control Panel

1. On the Control Panel, click on the **Stop** button.
   Stopping the server takes several seconds. When the server is stopped, the **Stop** button becomes a **Start** button.
2. Close the Control Panel.

{{#> callout type='tip' }}

If you started the server using the `nuxeoctl start` command in the terminal, use the `nuxeoctl stop`&nbsp;command to stop it.

{{/callout}}

### Using the nuxeoctl Script

If you started the server using the `nuxeoctl start` command, in a terminal execute the&nbsp;`nuxeoctl` script with the&nbsp;`stop` command:

- Linux / macOS

  ```shell
  ./nuxeoctl stop
  ```

- Windows

  ```shell
  nuxeoctl.bat stop
  ```

If you started the server using the&nbsp;`nuxeoctl console` command, use `Ctrl+C` to stop the server.
