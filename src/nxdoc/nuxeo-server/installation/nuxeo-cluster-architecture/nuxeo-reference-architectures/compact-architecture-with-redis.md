## Architecture Description

In this architecture:
- A **load balancer** with sticky sessions is used.
- A total of two machines are prepared for the application cluster. Each machine holds a **Nuxeo server node**, a **Redis node**, and a **reverse proxy**. More machines can be added later for scalability purpose.
- Since we have **two Redis nodes**, we take advantage from it to configure Redis in [master / slave mode](https://redis.io/topics/replication).
- An **Elasticsearch cluster** with at least 3 nodes.
- A **database cluster** with at least 2 nodes.
- **Chronicle Queue** as the default implementation for Nuxeo Stream.

This architecture can be improved by externalizing the Redis node inside a specific cluster:

## Limitations

As detailed in the [messaging system page]({{page version='' space='nxdoc' page='messaging-system-architecture'}}#alternative-configuration-using-redis-no-kafka) this is not a recommended solution because:

- The processing done with the Bulk Service relies on Chronicle Queue which is not distributed (poor performance) and not fault tolerant.
- The WorkManager Queuing is limited by the amount of Redis memory and in case of failure Works might be lost.

**â†’ Jump to the [Compact architecture with Kafka]({{page page='compact-architecture-with-kafka'}})** to:
- Remove Redis and Chronicle Queue limitations
- Benefits from Kafka advantages
