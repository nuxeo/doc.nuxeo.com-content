## Architecture Description

Compared to the [Compact Architecture with Kafka]({{page page='compact-architecture-with-kafka'}}), this architecture includes a Kafka cluster and a Zookeeper cluster so that SPOF (single point of failure) no longer exists, and consequently provides a full high availability and fault tolerant Nuxeo architecture.

In this architecture:
- A load balancer with sticky sessions is used.
- A total of two machines are prepared for the application cluster. Each machine holds a Nuxeo server node and a reverse proxy. More machines can be added later for scalability purpose.
- An Elasticsearch cluster with at least 3 nodes
- A database cluster with at least 2 nodes
- A **Kafka cluster**, with at least 2 nodes, as the default implementation for Nuxeo Stream
- A **Zookeeper cluster**, with at least 3 nodes, to orchestrate the Kafka cluster nodes, Kafka topics, partitions etc.

## Limitations

At this stage, this architecture is fault tolerant and in high availability, and the architecture should be tuned depending on the kind of requests and loads.

**â†’ Check the [scalability options]({{page page='nuxeo-scalability-options'}})** to:
- Add Nuxeo nodes for specific loads (API node, worker node and import nodes)
- Set up data partitioning with database sharding and a multi-repository approach
