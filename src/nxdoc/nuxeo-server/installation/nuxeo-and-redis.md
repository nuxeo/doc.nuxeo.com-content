## Principles

{{! excerpt}}
Nuxeo provides a Redis integration via the `nuxeo-core-redis` bundle.
{{! /excerpt}}

{{#> callout type='warning' }}
If you are targetting to store more than hundred millions of document, you should consider using [Kafka]({{page page='kafka'}}) instead of Redis.
{{/callout}}

Redis is not a hard requirement for running the Nuxeo Platform; it is used as a backend to provide alternate implementation of some services inside the platform. However, we do provide these implementations because we think they can be useful.

{{#> callout type='info' }}
Nuxeo can use Redis to store both data to be persisted (e.g. jobs list) and transient data (e.g. cache data). After a normal cluster shutdown, you can flush (erase) the transient data in Redis. Note however that Nuxeo can not work with a Redis configured as an [LRU cache](http://redis.io/topics/lru-cache); there should be no eviction under memory pressure.
{{/callout}}

{{#> callout type='warning' }}
Using Nuxeo in cluster mode does not necessarily need Redis, for more info check the related documentation below.
{{/callout}}

## Nuxeo Core Cache

Nuxeo Core Cache provides a service to declare and use caches. This cache system is used for:

- Nuxeo Directories (caching directories entries)
- UserManager (caching principals)
- Nuxeo Drive (caching synchronization roots)

It can also be used in your custom code.

The Cache has a default "in memory" implementation, but `nuxeo-core-redis` provides another implementation that allows to:

- Have an out of JVM memory cache storage.</br>
  It opens the way to have big caches without hurting the JVM.
- Share the same cache between several Nuxeo nodes.</br>
  In cluster mode this can increase cache efficiency.
- Manage cluster wide invalidations.</br>
  Updating the user on one node will impact the central cache: all nodes see the exact same data.

You can configure the backend storage on a per cache basis:&nbsp;Directory A could use Redis while directory B could use in memory.

## Work Manager

The WorkManager handles asynchronous jobs:

- Schedule Jobs and store them in queues
- Assign execution slots to queues
- Execute the jobs

In the default implementation, job queues are in the JVM memory. But this model has some limitations:

- Stacking a lot of jobs will consume JVM Memory
- In cluster mode each Nuxeo node maintains its own queue
- When a Nuxeo server is restarted, all the queued jobs are lost

`nuxeo-core-redis` provides an alternate implementation of the queuing system based on Redis:

- Jobs are then stored outside of JVM memory.</br>
  That's why Work have to be serializable: they are serialized and stored in Redis.
- Jobs can be shared across cluster nodes.</br>
  This allows to dedicate some nodes to some specific processing.
- Jobs survive a Nuxeo restart.</br>
  When Redis persistence is activated, the jobs even survive a Redis restart.

## Lock Manager

By default Lock managed on documents are stored in the repository backend. When the locking system is heavily used, it can create a lot of very small transactions against the database backend.

`nuxeo-core-redis` provides a Redis-based implementation of the locking system that is resilient as the database implementation, but easier to scale.

## Clustering invalidation

### Visual Content Store ([VCS]({{page page='vcs'}})) Row Cache Invalidation

Managing *VCS* (Meaning RDBMS) row cache invalidations with [Redis instead of using the database](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-14923) can improve performance on concurrent writes and provides synchronous invalidations.

### Document Based Storage ([DBS]({{page page='dbs'}})) Cache Invalidation

For Nuxeo 8.10 and 9.10 the *DBS* layer (used to connect with MongoDB or Marklogic) [has a cache](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-20640) its invalidation in cluster mode requires Redis.

{{#> callout type='warning' }}
A Nuxeo No-Redis cluster configuration can be applied at certain conditions, see: [No-Redis Nuxeo Cluster Configuration]({{page page='nxdoc/kafka/#andquotno-redisandquot-nuxeo-cluster') for more info.
{{/callout}}

## Transient Store

The `RedisTransientStore`&nbsp;is a Redis-based implementation of the [Transient Store]({{page page='transient-store'}}).

It is not anymore the **default** Transient Store when Redis is enabled since **LTS2019**, more details in: [NXP-26581](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-26581).

The old Redis Transient Store can still be used with `nuxeo.transientstore.provider=redis` set in the `nuxeo.conf`, but it is not cluster safe. Binaries are temporarily stored in the Nuxeo node's file system. More details in: [NXP-21871](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-21871).

## Clean-up

After a Nuxeo node crash (low-level error, machine reboot, etc.), Redis may still contain data that Nuxeo didn't have the opportunity to clean up.

{{#> callout type='info' }}
In the following Lua scripts, the `nuxeo:` prefix is used for Redis keys. If a different value is set for `nuxeo.redis.prefix` in `nuxeo.conf`, you should update the code samples accordingly.
More detail in [Configuring Nuxeo for Redis]({{page page='nxdoc/redis-configuration/#configuring-nuxeo-for-redis').
{{/callout}}

### Running workers
The following code can be used with the Redis client to delete old workers marked as running:
```
local keys = redis.call('KEYS', 'nuxeo:work:run:*')

for _,k in ipairs(keys) do
	redis.call('DEL', k)
end
```
Copy this code to a file named `delete_running_works.lua`:
```
redis-cli --eval /path/to/delete_running_works.lua
```

It finds all keys prefixed with `nuxeo:work:run` and deletes them.

### Scheduled workers
The following code can be used with the Redis client to delete old workers marked as scheduled:
```
local keys = redis.call('KEYS', 'nuxeo:work:sched:*')

for _,k in ipairs(keys) do
  redis.call('DEL', k)
end
```
Copy this code to a file named `delete_scheduled_works.lua`:
```
redis-cli --eval /path/to/delete_scheduled_works.lua
```

It finds all keys prefixed with `nuxeo:work:sched` and deletes them.
