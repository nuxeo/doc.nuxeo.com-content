## Connecting to a Web Browser

{{! excerpt}}

It could sometimes be useful to browse the management beans remotely using your web browser. Nuxeo embeds a web console which is accessible on the port 8081 with the&nbsp;`operator` identity and your server key as password (`nuxeo.server.key`)

{{! /excerpt}}

This web console is not started by default.
You can start it by invoking locally in&nbsp;`JMX` the&nbsp;`start` operation on the managed bean `org.nuxeo:format=html,type=jmx-adaptor`.
An easy way to start the web console is to:

*   enable JMX on your server by uncommenting the&nbsp;`Enable JMX` line in your configuration (`nuxeo.conf`)
*   use a JMX command line such as&nbsp;`jmxterm` and run the following commands

```text
open localhost:1089
bean org.nuxeo:format=html,type=jmx-adaptor
run start
```

Then you should get a page with the list of all the available beans in your server by requesting the&nbsp;`http://localhost:8081` home page.

## Connecting to a JMX Client

If you need more advanced services such as those provided by the Java Mission Control application, you can connect them remotely using HTTP/S protocols through the DMK adapters. These adapters are not enabled by default and can be enabled as for the web console using the management beans `org.nuxeo:protocol=jdmk-http,type=jmx-connector` or `org.nuxeo:protocol=jdmk-https,type=jmx-connector`.

You must then add the DMK agent library `com.sun.jdmk:core`&nbsp; to the `JMX` client classpath. For example, with the&nbsp;Java Mission Control console, you have to add the following line to the&nbsp;`JVM` arguments section in your&nbsp;`jmc.ini`.

```text
-vmargs
-Xbootclasspath/a:/../nuxeo/nxserver/lib/core-1.0-b02.jar
```

In the Java Mission Control, create a connection using the URI `service:jmx:jdmk-http://hostname:6868`. You may retrieve that URI from the managed bean attribute `Address`.
