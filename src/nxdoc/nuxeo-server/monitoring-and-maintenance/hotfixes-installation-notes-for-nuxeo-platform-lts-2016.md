{{{multiexcerpt 'intro_hotfix' page='ADMINDOC710:Hotfixes Installation Notes for Nuxeo Platform LTS 2015'}}}

{{#> callout type='warning' }}
While installing hotfixes, you will see the following message, but you can ignore it and continue.  
```
Use of the <copy /> command on JAR files is not recommended, prefer using <update /> command to ensure a safe rollback. (nuxeo-launcher-8.10-HF01-jar-with-dependencies.jar)
```
{{/callout}}

## Instance Registration
Hotfixes released for LTS 2016 can only be used on valid, registered Nuxeo instances.

**Why?** </br>
If you are using an *unregistered LTS 2016 Nuxeo instance with hotfixes installed*, you may encounter the following behavior:
- A warning will be displayed in the logs during startup,

```
ERROR [RuntimeService] NUXEO INSTANCE NOT REGISTERED

***** This Nuxeo instance is not registered *****
It can only be used for development and will be stopped if used in production
```
- Over a certain level of use the server will be stopped automatically. When this happens, a message is displayed in the logs to inform you as well.

```
ERROR [RuntimeService] NUXEO INSTANCE STOPPING

***** This Nuxeo instance is not registered *****
Stopping Nuxeo instance due to threshold exceeded (TOTAL_COMMITS > 100000) after failed registration checks
```
The current limits of use are:
- 100,000 transaction commits
- 10 concurrent sessions (a session correspond to an access to the core)

If the expiration date is close (less than 15 days), a warning will be displayed and indicate how many days are left before expiration.
In the JSF UI, a message based on the Administrative message mechanism will be displayed: all users will be informed.

After expiration date, the following message will be displayed in the logs at startup:
```
ERROR [RuntimeService] NUXEO INSTANCE REGISTRATION EXPIRED

***** This Nuxeo instance registration is expired *****
It can only be used for development and will be stopped if used in production
```

The following message will be displayed in the logs when Nuxeo will be stopped automatically according to the same conditions as described earlier:
```
ERROR [RuntimeService] NUXEO INSTANCE STOPPING

***** This Nuxeo instance registration is expired *****
Stopping Nuxeo instance due to threshold exceeded (TOTAL_COMMITS > 100000) after registration expiration
```

**How Can I Avoid This?** </br>
Make sure to [register your Nuxeo instance]({{page version='810' space='nxdoc' page='registering-your-nuxeo-instance'}}): this can be done both for online and offline instances.

**Could it Break My CI Chain? Do I Need to Register My Test Instances?** </br>
The level of use needed  to stop an *unregistered instance with hotfixes* has been tuned to prevent any problems with CI chain tests. It would be possible to run the full test suite of Nuxeo server (both unit tests AND integration tests) several times before anything would happen.

Nevertheless, it is recommended to register your test instances, especially if you wish to test features that require heavy usage (e.g. load testing or mass import).

**How Often Do I Need to Register My Instance?** </br>
{{#> callout type='warning' }}
Registration tokens are valid until your current contract's expiration date. When renewing your Nuxeo Online Services subscription, you should register your instances again.
{{/callout}}

**I Have More Questions, Who Can I Ask For Help?** </br>
If you have any questions, feel free to contact our support team via a dedicated support ticket.

## Hotfix 25

### CSRF Protection for Platform

CSRF protection is activated by default and based on the CORS configuration and its `allowOrigin` and `supportedMethods` parameters, which by default doesn't allow any cross origin.

To activate an insecure configuration that allows any cross origin, use:
```
<extension target="org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.web.common.requestcontroller.service.RequestControllerService" point="corsConfig">
    <!-- THIS IS INSECURE -->
    <corsConfig name="insecure" allowOrigin="*" supportedMethods="GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,POST,PUT,DELETE" >
      <pattern>/.*</pattern>
    </corsConfig>
</extension>
```
This configuration may fix the error `HTTP 403 - CSRF check failure`.
See the [related documentation page]({{page version='' space='nxdoc' page='cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors'}}) for more information.

### Stack Trace in REST API Exception

The exception stack trace is written if the media type is application/json+nxentity but it can be disabled for security reason with the `nuxeo.rest.write.exception.stack.trace` configuration parameter, which is set to `true` by default.

To disable it, use this code:
```
<extension target="org.nuxeo.runtime.ConfigurationService" point="configuration">
  <property name="nuxeo.rest.write.exception.stack.trace">false</property>
</extension>
```

## Hotfix 24

### New Searchable Property in Elasticsearch: ecm:versionVersionableId

With an Elasticsearch NXQL query you can retrieve all versions of a document by version series id. To search existing documents by `ecm:versionVersionableId` a re-index is required. This could either be done via a full re-index or a re-index of just documents that have versions, using this query:
```
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:isVersion = 1
```

## Hotfix 23

### Dirty fields validation at creation

To enable the fix done by [NXP-23267](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-23267) and provided by HF19, you have now to set the `org.nuxeo.core.validate.dirty.only.creation` parameter with `false` value.
```
  <require>org.nuxeo.core.validation.create.document.dirty.contrib</require>
  <extension target="org.nuxeo.runtime.ConfigurationService" point="configuration">
    <property name="org.nuxeo.core.validate.dirty.only.creation">false</property>
  </extension>
```
Using this property was added not to break the project which were correctly working with the bug on dirty field validation.

## Hotfix 20

### Read ACL optimization on big volume

This feature is activated by setting the property `nuxeo.core.readacl.async.enabled=true` in nuxeo.conf. Default value is `false`.

When the feature is activated, the Nuxeo property `nuxeo.core.readacl.async.threshold` can be set to a value (`500` by default) above which Read ACL recomputation is done asynchronously.


## Hotfix 19

### Validation constraint at creation

[NXP-23267](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-23267) has fixed a bug where the validation was not done on all the document fields. For example the validation was not working:
- if a field was not present on the creation form
- if the document was created by an Automation call and no properties were passed for a field with constraint (required field, directory field, etc)

Once the hotfix 19 is applied, you will get a Validation exception whereas before the document was created without any error, which was faulty because a constraint was defined on these fields.

## Hotfix 15

### Security Issue on MS Windows

Windows users need to upgrade the Tomcat version to protect against a potential CSRF token leak in the default manager applications distributed with Tomcat. Follow this procedure to upgrade Tomcat to version `7.0.81`, version recommended by [NXP-19726](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-19726):
1. Open a PowerShell session.
2. Ensure you can run "java" and "jar" with the current `$env:Path` environment variable or set the `$env:Path` as needed.
3. Set the `ExecutionPolicy` to "Unrestricted" (see [Microsoft usage notes](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170)).
4. Run the script using the following command line format (using full path to `NUXEO_HOME`):
```
upgrade_tomcat7.ps1 NUXEO_HOME 7.0.81
```
(The script is available under `NUXEO_HOME\templates\common-base\client\scripts` when distributed by Hotfix 15, while the source of the script is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo/blob/8.10/nuxeo-distribution/nuxeo-nxr-server/src/main/resources/templates/common-base/client/scripts/upgrade_tomcat7.ps1)).
5. Restore the ExecutionPolicy to your default level.
6. Exit the PowerShell session.


## Hotfix 10

### Package Upgrade
If you are using Nuxeo JSF UI, you must upgrade the package `nuxeo-jsf-ui` to version 8.10.1 to keep the workflows working. Run the following command from the command line to upgrade the installed packages:
```
./nuxeoctl mp-upgrade
```

## Hotfix 09

### Traffic Encryption in Elasticsearch
This hotfix brings a new default template for the Elasticsearch configuration to enable traffic encryption with the following properties:
```
    elasticsearch.shield.keystore.path
    elasticsearch.shield.keystore.password
```
If you have customized the template `templates/common-base/nxserver/config/elasticsearch-config.xml.nxftl`, please report the changes from this [diff](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo/commit/035174c9645eb1689d6216dda85202efe7f8be47) to your custom template.

## Hotfix 01

### DBS Cache Configuration

This hotfix brings a new default template to configure a DBS repository. It exposes new parameters to configure the cache, which are listed below with their default value:
```
nuxeo.dbs.cache.enabled=true
nuxeo.dbs.cache.maxSize=1000
nuxeo.dbs.cache.concurrencyLevel=10
nuxeo.dbs.cache.ttl=10
```

### Orphan Versions Cleanup

[NXP-14187](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-14187) addresses the cleanup of orphan versions, left after a recursive delete (deletion of a folder). However this cleanup is disabled by default. To enable it, you have to add the following contribution:

```
  <extension target="org.nuxeo.ecm.core.scheduler.SchedulerService" point="schedule">
    <schedule id="orphanVersionsCleanup">
      <!-- cleanup every day at 1:30 AM -->
      <cronExpression>0 30 1 * * ?</cronExpression>
      <event>orphanVersionsCleanup</event>
    </schedule>
  </extension>
```

### Automation Compatibility

Some operations have been renamed since LTS 2015 and cannot be used any more with the Java Automation Client. Use the following contribution to enable the aliases and fix the bug:
```
<extension target="org.nuxeo.runtime.ConfigurationService" point="configuration">
  <property name="nuxeo.automation.export.aliases">true</property>
</extension>
```
