{{#> callout type='warning' }}
While installing hotfixes, you will see the following message, but you can ignore it and continue.  
```
Use of the <copy /> command on JAR files is not recommended, prefer using <update /> command to ensure a safe rollback. (nuxeo-launcher-9.10-HF01-jar-with-dependencies.jar)
```

## Instance Registration
Hotfixes released for LTS 2017 can only be used on valid, registered Nuxeo instances.

**Why?** </br>
If you are using an *unregistered LTS 2017 Nuxeo instance with hotfixes installed*, you may encounter the following behavior:
- A warning will be displayed in the logs during startup,

```
ERROR [RuntimeService] NUXEO INSTANCE NOT REGISTERED

***** This Nuxeo instance is not registered *****
It can only be used for development and will be stopped if used in production
```
- Over a certain level of use the server will be stopped automatically. When this happens, a message is displayed in the logs to inform you as well.

```
ERROR [RuntimeService] NUXEO INSTANCE STOPPING

***** This Nuxeo instance is not registered *****
Stopping Nuxeo instance due to threshold exceeded (TOTAL_COMMITS > 100000) after failed registration checks
```
The current limits of use are:
- 100,000 transaction commits
- 10 concurrent sessions (a session correspond to an access to the core)

If the expiration date is close (less than 15 days), a warning will be displayed and indicate how many days are left before expiration.
In the JSF UI, a message based on the Administrative message mechanism will be displayed: all users will be informed.

After expiration date, the following message will be displayed in the logs at startup:
```
ERROR [RuntimeService] NUXEO INSTANCE REGISTRATION EXPIRED

***** This Nuxeo instance registration is expired *****
It can only be used for development and will be stopped if used in production
```

The following message will be displayed in the logs when Nuxeo will be stopped automatically according to the same conditions as described earlier:
```
ERROR [RuntimeService] NUXEO INSTANCE STOPPING

***** This Nuxeo instance registration is expired *****
Stopping Nuxeo instance due to threshold exceeded (TOTAL_COMMITS > 100000) after registration expiration
```

**How Can I Avoid This?** </br>
Make sure to [register your Nuxeo instance]({{page version='810' space='nxdoc' page='registering-your-nuxeo-instance'}}): this can be done both for online and offline instances.

**Could it Break My CI Chain? Do I Need to Register My Test Instances?** </br>
The level of use needed  to stop an *unregistered instance with hotfixes* has been tuned to prevent any problems with CI chain tests. It would be possible to run the full test suite of Nuxeo server (both unit tests AND integration tests) several times before anything would happen.

Nevertheless, it is recommended to register your test instances, especially if you wish to test features that require heavy usage (e.g. load testing or mass import).

**How Often Do I Need to Register My Instance?** </br>
{{#> callout type='warning' }}
Registration tokens are valid until your current contract's expiration date. When renewing your Nuxeo Online Services subscription, you should register your instances again.

## Hotfix 01

### New searchable property in Elasticsearch: ecm:versionVersionableId

With an Elasticsearch NXQL query you can retrieve all versions of a document by version series id. To search existing documents by ecm:versionVersionableId a re-index is required. This could either be done via a full re-index or a re-index of just documents that have versions, using this query:
```
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:isVersion = 1
```
