## NXQL Syntax

The general syntax of a NXQL expression is:

```sql
SELECT (*|[DISTINCT] <select-clause>) FROM <from-clause> [WHERE <where-clause>] [ ORDER BY <order-by-clause> ]
```

The `<select-clause>` is a comma-separated list of `<property>`, or `<aggregate>` since Nuxeo 5.9.2.

A `<property>` is a Nuxeo document property name, for instance `dc:modified` , or a special properties, for instance `ecm:uuid` (see below).

An `<aggregate>` is of the form `<agg-function>` ( `_<property>_` ) (available since Nuxeo 5.9.2, see [NXP-13708](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-13708)).

An `<agg-function>` can be:

*   `COUNT`
*   `AVG`
*   `SUM`
*   `MIN`
*   `MAX`

The `<from-clause>` is a comma-separated list of document types.

The optional `<where-clause>` is a general `<predicate>`.

The optional `<order-by-clause>` is a comma-separated list of `<identifier>`, each one being optionally followed by `ASC` or `DESC` (`ASC` is the default).

A `<predicate>` can be:

*   `<predicate> <operator> <predicate>`
*   `<identifier> [NOT] IN ( <literal-list> )`
*   `<identifier> [NOT] BETWEEN <literal> AND <literal>`
*   `<identifier> IS [NOT] NULL`
*   `( <predicate> )`
*   `NOT <predicate>`
*   `<expression>`

An `<operator>` can be:

*   `AND`
*   `OR`
*   `=`
*   `<>` (or `!=` for Java compatibility and to make it convenient to write XML files)
*   `<`
*   `<=`
*   `>`
*   `>=`
*   [`NOT`] (`LIKE`|`ILIKE`) (only between an `<identifier>` and a `<string>`)
*   `STARTSWITH` (only between an `<identifier>` and a `<string>`)

{{#> callout type='note' }}

Be careful with Oracle when comparing a value with an empty string, as in Oracle an empty string is `NULL`. For instance `dc:description <> ''` will never match any document, and `dc:description IS NULL` will also match for an empty description.

{{/callout}}

An `<expression>` can be:

*   `<expression><op><expression>`
*   `(<expression>)`
*   `<literal>`
*   `<identifier>`

An `<op>` can be:

*   `+`
*   `-`
*   `*`
*   `/`

A `<literal>` can be:

*   `<string>`: a string delimited by single quotes (`'`) or for Java compatibility double quotes (`"`). To use the string delimiter itself inside the string, it must be escaped by a backslash ( `\'` or `\"`) (this is contrary to the standard SQL syntax which would double the delimiter). The backslash itself is also escaped by a backslash ( `\\` ). The special `\n`, `\r` and `\t` can also be used.
*   `<integer>`: an integer with optional minus sign.
*   `<float>`: a float.
*   `TIMESTAMP <timestamp>`: a timestamp in ISO format _yyyy_ `-` _MM_ `-` _dd_ _hh_ `:` _mm_ `:` _ss_[`.` _sss_] (the space separator can be replaced by a `T`).
*   `DATE` _<date>_: a date in ISO format _yyyy_ `-` _MM_ `-` _dd_, converted internally to a timestamp by adding `00:00:00` to it.

A `<literal-list>` is a non empty comma-separated list of `<literal>`.

An `<identifier>` is a property identifier. This can be only a simple property, a simple list property or a complex property element, maybe including wildcards for list indexes (see below).

## Operators

The semantics of a few specific operators is described below.

`LIKE` (and `ILIKE`) behave like in the SQL standard, meaning that the `_` and `%` characters are wildcards: `_` matches a single arbitrary character, and `%` matches any number of characters (including zero).

`STARTSWITH` matches path-like values. When used with `ecm:path`, it matches documents whose path is strictly under the specified path. When used with an arbitrary string-based property, it assumes that the property value has the form of a `/`-separated path, and then matches if the value is equal to or under the specified path.

## List Properties

A Nuxeo property representing a list of simple values (like `dc:subjects`) can be queried as if it represented a simple value, and Nuxeo will automatically expand the query to match any of the values in the list. The following example will find the documents where **any** subject is _foo_:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE dc:subjects = 'foo'
```

Note that the above does **not** mean to find the documents where the list of subjects is exactly the list _[foo]_; NXQL (and indeed SQL) does not have enough expressivity for that (and it would be quite slow).

The above example shows the `=` operator, and the same semantics apply for the operators `IN`, `LIKE` and `ILIKE`.

When using **negative queries**, though, the semantics become a bit more complex. The following example will find the documents where **no** subject is _foo_:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE dc:subjects <> 'foo'
```

Note that the above **does not** mean to find the documents where there is at least one subject that is not _foo_.

The above example shows the `<>` operator, and the same semantics apply for the other negative operators `NOT IN`, `NOT LIKE` and `NOT ILIKE`.

The complex property syntax (described in detail further down) can be used to match single list elements. The following two queries will do the same thing:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE dc:subjects = 'foo'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE dc:subjects/* = 'foo'
```

There is however an important difference in the mechanism with which these two requests are executed internally. The first syntax internally uses a SQL `EXISTS` and a subquery. The second one uses a SQL `JOIN` (with a SQL `DISTINCT` if `SELECT *` is used). The end result is usually the same unless you want to use `CoreSession.queryAndFetch` with no `DISTINCT` to get to the actual matching subjects, then only the second form is usable

In the case where negative queries are used, however, the different execution mechanisms imply that the two syntaxes mean different things:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE dc:subjects <> 'foo'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE dc:subjects/* <> 'foo'     -- not the same thing as above
```

The first syntax, as already explained, will find the documents where **no** subject is _foo_.

The second syntax will find the documents where there is **at least one** subject which **is not** _foo_.

To find documents whose list field is empty, you will use the `/*` syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE dc:subjects/* IS NULL
```

## {{> anchor 'reference'}} Complex Properties

You can refer to complex properties in NXQL, after the `SELECT`, in the `WHERE` clause, and in the `ORDER BY` clause (cf [NXP-4464](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-4464)).

A complex property is a property of a schema containing `<xs:simpleType>` lists, or `<xs:complexType>` sub-elements or sequences of them.

For complex sub-properties, like the `length` field of the `content` field of the `file` schema, you can refer to:

*   `content/length` for the value of the subproperty.

For simple lists, like `dc:subjects`, you can refer to:

*   `dc:subjects/3` for the 4th element of the list (indexes start at 0),
*   `dc:subjects/*` for any element of the list,
*   `dc:subjects/*1` for any element of the list, correlated with other uses of the same number after `*`.

For complex lists, like the elements of the `files` schema, you can refer to:

*   `files/3/file/length` for the length of the 4th file (again, indexes start at 0),
*   `files/*/`file/`length` for any length
*   `files/*1/`file/`length` for any length, correlated with other uses of the same number after `*`.

It's important to note that if you use a `*` then the resulting SQL `JOIN` generated may return several resulting rows, which means that if you use the `CoreSession.queryAndFetch` API you may get several results for the same document.

The difference between `*` and `*1` gets important when you refer to the same expression twice, for instance if you want the documents with an optional attached of given characteristics, you must correlate the queries.

This returns the documents with an attached text file of length 0:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE files/*1/file/name LIKE '%.txt' AND files/*1/file/length = 0

```

This returns the documents with an attached text file and an attached file of length 0:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE files/*/file/name LIKE '%.txt' AND files/*/file/length = 0
```

## Special NXQL Properties

The following properties are not legal as document property names, but are allowed in NXQL.

**ecm:uuid**: the document id (`DocumentModel.getId()`).

**ecm:parentId**: the document parent id.

**ecm:path**: the document path (`DocumentModel.getPathAsString()`). This is a synthetic value (computed from the `ecm:name` of the document's ancestors) and therefore cannot be used in all contexts. It cannot be used in the `<select-clause>`.</br>
In the `<where-clause>` it may only be used with operators `=`, `<>` (or `!=`) and `STARTSWITH`.</br>
Using it in the `<order-by-clause>` carries a large performance penalty when using `CoreSession.query`, and it cannot be used in the `<order-by-clause>` when using `CoreSession.queryAndFetch`. See also **ecm:ancestorId**.

**ecm:name**: the document name (`DocumentModel.getName()`).

**ecm:pos**: the document position in its parent, this is `NULL` in non-ordered folders. This is mainly used in the `<order-by-clause>`.

**ecm:primaryType**: the document type (`DocumentModel.getType()`).

**ecm:mixinType**: a list of the document facets (`DocumentModel.getFacets()`) with some restrictions. 1\. the facet _Immutable_ is never seen. 2\. the facets _Folderish_ and _HiddenInNavigation_ are never seen on document instances (only if they're on the type). 3\. like for other list properties, it can be used only with operators `=`, `<>`, `IN` and `NOT IN`.

**ecm:currentLifeCycleState**: the document lifecycle state (`DocumentModel.getCurrentLifeCycleState()`).

**ecm:isTrashed**: `1` if the document is in the trash and `0` if not. This can only be compared to `1` or `0`. (Since Nuxeo 10.1)

**ecm:isCheckedIn**: `1` if the document is checked in and `0` if not (the opposite of `DocumentModel.isCheckedOut()`). This can only be compared to `1` or `0`. (Since Nuxeo 5.7.3)

**ecm:isProxy**: `1` for proxies and `0` for non-proxies (`DocumentModel.isProxy()`). This can only be compared to `1` or `0`.

**ecm:isVersion**: `1` for versions and `0` for non-version (`DocumentModel.isVersion()`). This can only be compared to `1` or `0`.

**ecm:isCheckedInVersion**: deprecated name for **ecm:isVersion**.

**ecm:versionLabel**: the version label for versions (`DocumentModel.getVersionLabel()` only for a version), `NULL` if it's not a version.

**ecm:versionDescription**: the version description for versions, `NULL` if it's not a version. (Since Nuxeo 5.7.3)

**ecm:versionCreated**: the version creation time for versions, `NULL` if it's not a version. (Since Nuxeo 5.7.3)

**ecm:versionVersionableId**: the id of the versionable document of a version (the versionable document is the one from which the version was created). (Since Nuxeo 5.7.3)

**ecm:isLatestVersion**: `1` if this is the latest version of a document, `0` if not. This can only be compared to `1` or `0`. (Since Nuxeo 5.7.3)

**ecm:isLatestMajorVersion**: `1` if this is the latest major version of a document, `0` if not. This can only be compared to `1` or `0`. (Since Nuxeo 5.7.3)

**ecm:proxyTargetId**: the id of the target of a proxy (usually a version). Implies a search for proxies (`ecm:isProxy = 1`). (Since Nuxeo 5.7.1)

**ecm:proxyVersionableId**: the id of the versionable document of a proxy (the versionable document is the one from which the version to which the proxy is pointing was created). Implies a search for proxies (`ecm:isProxy = 1`). (Since Nuxeo 5.7.1)

**ecm:lockOwner**: the lock owner (`DocumentModel.getLockInfo().getOwner()`).

**ecm:lockCreated**: the lock creation date (`DocumentModel.getLockInfo().getCreated()`).

**ecm:lock**: deprecated name for **ecm:lockOwner**.

**ecm:fulltext**: a special field to make full-text queries, see [Full-Text Queries]({{page page='full-text-queries'}}) for more.

**ecm:fulltextScore**: a special field representing the full-text score. This can be used in an `ORDER BY` clause, or in the `SELECT` clause when using `CoreSession.queryAndFetch`. It must be used in conjunction with an **ecm:fulltext** match in the `WHERE` clause. (Since Nuxeo 5.9.6)

**ecm:tag**: a tag of the document. This property, when used multiple times in the same query, always refers to the same tag. If you want to refer to multiple tags in the same query, you can use a wildcard syntax similar to complex properties: every instance of **ecm:tag/*** will always refer to a different tag. If you want to refer several times to the same tag but still have flexibility, use correlated wildcards like for lists: **ecm:tag/*1**, **ecm:tag/*2**, etc. See the examples below for more. (Since Nuxeo 5.7.1)

**ecm:ancestorId**: the id of an ancestor of the document (parent, grand-parent, etc., up to the root). This is only useable in a `WHERE` clause with the syntax `ecm:ancestorId = 'some-doc-id'` or `ecm:ancestorId <> 'some-doc-id'`. It's an alternative to `ecm:path STARTSWITH '/some/doc/path'` if you know the id instead of the path. See also **ecm:path**. (Since Nuxeo 5.9.6)

**ecm:acl**: a pseudo-list giving access to ACLs, which needs to be used with a suffix specifying which part of the ACL is accessed. Available are **ecm:acl/*/principal** (ACL principal), **ecm:acl/*/permission** (ACL permission), **ecm:acl/*/grant** (ACL grant/deny, a boolean), **ecm:acl/*/name** (ACL name), **ecm:acl/*/pos** (ACL position). If you want to refer several times to the same ACL but still have flexibility, use correlated wildcards like for lists: **ecm:acl/*1/principal**, **ecm:acl/*2/permission**, etc. See the examples below for more. Note that this is a query on the ACLs that were set on a specific folder or document, _NOT_ on the resolved permissions according to the inheritance rules. (Since Nuxeo 6.0-HF06 or Nuxeo 7.2)

SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:parentId = '62cc5f29-f33e-479e-b122-e3922396e601' ORDER BY ecm:pos

```

You can use `IS NULL`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE dc:expired IS NOT NULL
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE dc:language = '' OR dc:language IS NULL

```

You can use complex properties:

```sql
SELECT * FROM File WHERE content/length > 0
SELECT * FROM File WHERE content/name = 'testfile.txt'
SELECT * FROM File ORDER BY content/length DESC
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE tst:couple/first/firstname = 'Steve'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE tst:friends/0/firstname = 'John'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE tst:friends/*/firstname = 'John'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE tst:friends/*1/firstname = 'John' AND tst:friends/*1/lastname = 'Smith'
SELECT tst:friends/*1/lastname FROM Document WHERE tst:friends/*1/firstname = 'John'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE dc:subjects/0 = 'something'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE dc:subjects/* = 'something'
SELECT dc:subjects/*1 FROM Document WHERE dc:subjects/*1 LIKE 'abc%'

```

Since Nuxeo 5.7.1 you can use `ecm:tag`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:tag = 'tag1'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:tag IN ('tag1', 'tag2')               -- documents with either tag
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:tag/* = 'tag1' AND ecm:tag/* = 'tag2' -- documents with both tags
SELECT ecm:tag FROM Document WHERE dc:title = 'something'              -- with queryAndFetch
SELECT ecm:tag FROM Document WHERE ecm:tag LIKE 'abc%'                 -- with queryAndFetch
SELECT ecm:tag/*1 FROM Document WHERE ecm:tag/*1 LIKE 'abc%' AND ecm:tag/*2 = 'tag1'
SELECT ecm:tag FROM Document WHERE ecm:tag LIKE 'abc%' AND ecm:tag/* = 'tag1'  -- simpler version of above
```

Since Nuxeo 5.7.1 you can also use `ecm:proxyTargetId` and `ecm:proxyVersionableId`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:proxyTargetId = '62cc5f29-f33e-479e-b122-e3922396e601'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:proxyVersionableId = '5442fff5-06f1-47c9-ac59-1e10ef8e985b'
```

Since Nuxeo 5.7.3 you can match the "checked in" state of a document:

```sql
 SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:isCheckedIn = 1
```

Since Nuxeo 5.7.3 you can use additional version-related properties:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:isVersion = 1
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:isLatestVersion = 1
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:isLatestMajorVersion = 1
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:versionCreated >= TIMESTAMP '2007-03-15 00:00:00'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:versionLabel = '1.0'                 -- this was available even before Nuxeo 5.7.3
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:versionDescription LIKE '%TODO%'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:versionVersionableId = '5442fff5-06f1-47c9-ac59-1e10ef8e985b'
```

Since Nuxeo 5.9.2 you can use aggregates in queries made with `CoreSession.queryAndFetch`:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(ecm:uuid) FROM Document WHERE dc:title = 'foo'
SELECT MIN(my:value), MAX(my:value) FROM Document WHERE dc:title = 'bar'
```

Since Nuxeo 5.9.6 you can use `ecm:ancestorId =` with an id as an alternative to `ecm:path STARTSWITH` with a path:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:ancestorId = 'c5904f77-299a-411e-8477-81d3102a81f9'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:ancestorId <> 'c5904f77-299a-411e-8477-81d3102a81f9'
```

Since Nuxeo 6.0-HF06 or Nuxeo 7.2 you can use `ecm:acl` (usually with correlated wildcards):

```
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:acl/*1/principal = 'bob'
                         AND ecm:acl/*1/grant = 1
                         AND ecm:acl/*1/permission IN ('Browse', 'Read', 'ReadProperties', 'ReadWrite', 'ReadRemove', 'Everything')
```

### Fulltext Examples

This uses standard SQL LIKE and usually has poor performance:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE dc:title LIKE 'Test%'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE dc:title ILIKE 'test%'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE dc:contributors LIKE 'pe%'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE dc:subjects LIKE '%oo%'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE dc:subjects NOT LIKE '%oo%'

```

This is a standard full-text query (see [Full-Text Queries]({{page page='full-text-queries'}}) for more):

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:fulltext = 'foo'
```

The following uses a full-text index that has to be additionally configured by administrators:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:fulltext_title = 'world'

```

The following uses a full-text index if one is configured for the dc:title field, otherwise it uses ILIKE-based queries:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:fulltext.dc:title = 'brave'

```

Since Nuxeo 5.9.6, use can express an explicit order on the full-text score, and request it from `CoreSession.queryAndFetch`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:fulltext = 'foo' ORDER BY ecm:fulltextScore DESC
SELECT ecm:uuid, ecm:fulltextScore FROM Document WHERE ecm:fulltext = 'foo'        -- with queryAndFetch
```

## {{> anchor 'mongodblimitations'}} Notes about MongoDB

The above describes the NXQL capabilities for a VCS repository, but if MongoDB is used a few limitations to the query model have to be taken into account.

### MongoDB NXQL Limitations

The following limitations apply:

*   Predicates of the form `<predicate>` `<operator>` `<predicate>` are restricted to the form `<identifier>` `<operator>` `<literal>`. This means that for instance the following are **not** allowed in a NXQL query on a MongoDB repository:
    *   `... WHERE dc:modified = dc:issued` (not allowed, cannot use two properties in a predicate)
    *   `... WHERE 123 = tst:value` (not allowed, property must be on the left-hand side)
    *   `... WHERE tst:value = 1000*1000` (not allowed, right-hand side must be a literal, not an expression)
*   Aggregates (`COUNT`, `AVERAGE`, `MAX`, `MIN`) are not supported.
*   `DISTINCT` is supported only for `ecm:uuid`.

## {{> anchor 'elasticsearchlimitations'}} Notes about Elasticsearch

When an NXQL query is processed by an [Elasticsearch PageProvider]({{page page='how-to-make-a-page-provider-or-content-view-query-elasticsearch-index'}}) or using the Nuxeo Elasticsearch search service, there are some limitations, specific configuration and more features available.

### Elasticsearch NXQL Limitations

*   Complex property correlations are not supported.

    Queries like this will not return any document:

    ```
    files:files/*1/file/name LIKE '%.txt' AND files:files/*1/file/length = 0 AND dc:subjects/3 = 'foo'
    ```

    Note that the match any `/*` is supported.

*   Canonical name for complex properties without prefix are not supported.
    You need to write `file:content/name` and not just `content/name`. See [NXP-15426](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-15426) for more information.
*   When using `query`, `queryAndFetch` or `queryAndAggregate` the select clause is limited to scalar properties: There is no support of NXQL aggregate like: `DISTINCT`, `COUNT`, `AVERAGE`, `MAX`, `MIN`, or operators like: `+ - / *`.
*   Custom securityPolicy expressible in NXQL is taken in account since [NXP-17371](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-17371), if the securityPolicy is not expressible in NXQL then total count or aggregates counts can be wrong.
*   `ecm:acl` and `ecm:tag` queries are not supported.

### Required Elasticsearch Configuration

#### Mapping

Without a proper mapping the following NXQL operators will not work by default:

*   Full-text search: `ecm:fulltext.my:field = 'foo'` works only if there is a multi field `my:field.fulltext` defined in the mapping.
*   `ILIKE`: `my:field ILIKE 'Foo'` works only if there is a multi field `my:field.lowercase` defined in the mapping.
*   `STARTSWITH`: `my:field STARTSWITH '/foo/bar'`: works only if there is a multi field `my:field.children` defined with proper analyzer. Note that `ecm:path.children` is already defined in the default mapping..

Visit the [mapping documentation]({{page page='configuring-the-elasticsearch-mapping'}}) for more information.

#### Full-Text Search

The full-text search is not configured the same way:

*   The `ecm:fulltext` matches the `all_field` field which is the concatenation of all fields. This is different from the NXQL `ecm:fulltext` which matches only some explicit fields. You can [adapt the mapping to exclude some fields]({{page page='elasticsearch-setup'}}).
*   Custom full-text indexes are not supported. `ecm:fulltext_someindex` will match the `all_field` field. It is possible to select a list of field using hints, see below.
*   In addition to the NXQL full-text syntax, it is also possible to use the Elasticsearch [simple query string syntax](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-simple-query-string-query.html#_simple_query_string_syntax).

### Elasticsearch NXQL Hints

NXQL hints enable to use more Elasticsearch operators.

The Elasticsearch hint syntax takes place just before an expression in the `where` clause:

```
/*+ES: INDEX(<index-list>) ANALYZER(<analyzer>) OPERATOR(<operator>) */ <expression><op><expression>
```

Where:

*   `<index-list>` is one or multiple Elasticsearch fields comma separated
*   `<analyzer>` is the name of an existing Elasticsearch analyzer, only used if the operator can handle it
*   `<operator>` overrides the NXQL expression operator and is one the following Elasticsearch operators:
    *   [common](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-common-terms-query.html)
    *   [fuzzy](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-fuzzy-query.html)
    *   [match](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-match-query.html)
    *   [match_phrase](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-match-query-phrase.html)
    *   [match_phase_prefix](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-match-query-phrase-prefix.html)
    *   [multi_match](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-multi-match-query.html)
    *   [query_string](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-query-string-query.html)
    *   [simple_query_string](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-simple-query-string-query.html)
    *   [regex](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-regexp-query.html)
    *   [wildcard](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-wildcard-query.html)
    *   [Geo location](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/geoloc.html) filters:
        *   [geo_bounding_box](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-geo-bounding-box-filter.html)
        *   [geo_distance](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-geo-distance-filter.html)
        *   [geo_distance_range](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-geo-distance-range-filter.html)
        *   [geo_shape](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-geo-shape-filter.html)

Here are some examples of NXQL queries using Elasticsearch hints:

```sql
-- Use an explicit Elasticsearch field
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE /*+ES: INDEX(dc:title.ngram) */ dc:title = 'foo'

-- Use fulltext search on an explicit list of fields, boosting dc:title
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE /*+ES: INDEX(dc:title.fulltext^3,dc:description.fulltext) */ ecm:fulltext = 'foo'

-- Use ES operators not present in NXQL
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE /*+ES: OPERATOR(regex) */ dc:title = 's.*y'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE /*+ES: OPERATOR(fuzzy) */ dc:title = 'zorkspaces'
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE /*+ES: OPERATOR(common) */ dc:title = 'this is bonsai cool'

-- Use default ES simple_query_string search on dc:title.fulltext field
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE /*+ES: INDEX(dc:title.fulltext) OPERATOR(simple_query_string) */ dc:title = '\"fried eggs\" +(eggplant | potato) -frittata'

-- Use ES query_string on multiple fields using a fulltext analyzer
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE /*+ES: INDEX(dc:title.fulltext,dc:description.fulltext) ANALYZER(fulltext) OPERATOR(query_string) */ dc:title = 'this AND that OR thus'

-- Use ES for GeoQuery based on geo_bounding location in a bounding box; first param is top_left, followed by bottom_right point
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE /*+ES: OPERATOR(geo_bounding_box) */ osm:location IN ('40.73, -74.1', '40.01, -71.12')

-- Use ES for GeoQuery based on geo_hash_cell location near a point using geohash; examples below use level 5 precision (approximately 5kmx5km)
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE /*+ES: OPERATOR(geo_hash_cell) */ osm:location IN ('40.73, -74.1', '5')
-- Note that the location can use geohash instead of latitude & longitude
SELECT * FROM Document WHERE /*+ES: OPERATOR(geo_hash_cell) */ osm:location IN ('drm3btev3e86', '5')
