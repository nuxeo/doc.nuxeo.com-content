# What's New in LTS 2023.19 / LTS 2023-HF19

## Configure Tomcat Logs With Log4j


Tomcat Log configuration with Log4j

The Tomcat logs configuration can be handled by Log4j which easily allows to configure Tomcat logs in Cloud environments.

The introduced configuration routes all Tomcat logs to `log/catalina.log` (without the date) with same level as with the JUL configuration under `conf/logging.properties`.
 This mechanism will be the default for LTS 2025 and must be opted-in in LTS 2023.
 You need to enable the `tomcat-logs` template for LTS 2023, for example by adding the following to your `nuxeo.conf`:
```java
nuxeo.append.templates.tomcat-logs=tomcat-logs
```

## Make the Nuxeo Launcher Log4j Configuration File Overridable


The Log4j configuration file for Nuxeo Launcher can now be customized.

Previously present in the launcher, the Nuxeo Launcher Log4j configuration file has been extracted to `/lib/log4j2-launcher.xml` so it could be edited.

A new `nuxeo.conf` property has been introduced to reference the log4j configuration file if needed:
```Java
launcher.log4j2.file=/etc/nuxeo/log4j2-launcher.xml
```
WARNING:
Variable expansion is not supported on this property because the property is used before launcher invocation, which owns this mechanism.

The `nuxeo.conf` and other nuxeo properties files are now read / written with UTF-8 encoding.
