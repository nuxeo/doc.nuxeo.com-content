Exception happening in WebEngine is now better identified when the requested MediaType is not `application/json`.

An exception writer has been added for `text/html` media type, so Nuxeo Server WebEngine now handles the following media type for NuxeoException handling:

- `text/html`
- `application/json` which is the default fallback for other media types

Fixed infinite login loop when the anonymous user is enabled

## Migration Tool to Extract Full Text From Mongo DB to an S3 Blob

In order to reduce the MongoDB collection size, itâ€™s now possible to move the fulltext extracted from binaries (stored in MongoDB) to a s3 bucket on an existing instance  in a efficient way. See the 4 step migration process in the upgrade notes.
