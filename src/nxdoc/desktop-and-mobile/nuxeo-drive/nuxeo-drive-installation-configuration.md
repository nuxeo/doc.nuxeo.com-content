## Requirements
To be able to synchronize folders on your computer, you need to install the Nuxeo Drive client on your computer.
We provide OS-specific installers for Mac OS X and Windows, available from the Nuxeo Drive tab of the Home.
For Linux, you need a PyQt4 with WebKit support.
{{#> callout type='note' }}
GNU/Linux support for Nuxeo Drive is fragile and currently depends on several obsolete modules. Keep an eye on our [roadmap]({{page page='nuxeo-drive-roadmap'}}) for developments and the [deployment instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-drive/blob/master/docs/deployment.md) for more information.
{{/callout}}

### Support

See this up-to-date [support page](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-drive/blob/master/docs/support.md) to know what OS vendor and version we are supporting; but also the Python version we are currently using.

## Installation

### Installing Nuxeo Drive Addon

{{{multiexcerpt 'MP-installation-easy' page='Generic Multi-Excerpts'}}}

After Nuxeo Drive has been installed on the server, a Nuxeo Drive tab in the user Home, from which you can see what Nuxeo spaces are synchronized with Drive.

### Installing Nuxeo Drive on Your Computer

If you try to synchronize a folder and you haven't installed the Nuxeo Drive client yet or haven't provided your credentials to the Nuxeo Drive client, you are automatically directed to the Nuxeo Drive home tab to install it.

#### Installing Nuxeo Drive on macOS

1.  Download the installer (`.dmg` file) from the **Nuxeo Drive** tab in the **Home** or from the [Nuxeo Drive update site](http://community.nuxeo.com/static/drive/latest/nuxeo-drive.dmg).
2.  Run the installer: drag and drop the Nuxeo Drive icon in the Applications directory.
    ![]({{file name='Drive-dmg-installer.png' page='nuxeo-drive'}} ?w=400,border=true)
    Nuxeo Drive is now installed on your computer.
3.  You now need to [start Nuxeo Drive](#starting-nuxeo-drive) on your computer.
    A Nuxeo Drive folder will be created by the system at the root of your local home folder (`/Users/USER/`). This is the place where synchronized documents will be stored on your computer.

#### Installing Nuxeo Drive on Windows

1.  Download the Windows installer (`.msi` file) from the **Nuxeo Drive** tab in the **Home** or from the [Nuxeo Drive update site](http://community.nuxeo.com/static/drive/latest/nuxeo-drive.msi).
2.  Run the installer: indicate where Nuxeo Drive should be installed (typically `C:\Program Files (x86)`) and click **Next** until the installation process is done.
    Nuxeo Drive is now installed on your computer.

    {{#> callout type='tip' }}

    If you have any problem due to a previous installation of Nuxeo Drive you can try using this [Microsoft tool](https://support.microsoft.com/fr-fr/mats/program_install_and_uninstall) to uninstall it properly.

    {{/callout}}
3.  You now need to [start Nuxeo Drive](#starting-nuxeo-drive) to use it.
    A new Nuxeo Drive folder will be created by the system in your local Documents folder (`C:\Users\USER\Documents\`). This is the place where synchronized documents will be stored on your computer.

#### Installing Nuxeo Drive on Ubuntu/Debian (and Other GNU/Linux Variants)

The .deb package of the client is not yet available. In the mean time you can manually install the development version. Has been reported to work on: Ubuntu >= 12.04.

To Install Nuxeo Drive on your Linux computer:

**Requirements**

1.  **xattr**

    First note that Nuxeo Drive uses Extended file attributes through the [xattr](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xattr/) Python wrapper.

    On **FreeBSD**, and **macOS**, xattrs are enabled in the default kernel.

    On **GNU/Linux**, depending on the distribution, you _may_ need a special mount option (`user_xattr`) to enable them for a given file system.

    Check your current mount, e.g.:
    ```
    cat /proc/fs/ext4/sda3/options | grep xattr
    # "user_xattr" means the file system has xattr already enabled
    ```

    If the current mount doesn't have xattr, remount the filesystem with xattr. e.g.:
    ```
    sudo mount -oremount,user_xattr /dev/sda3
    ```

2. **Python 2.7**

    Nuxeo Drive uses some packages, which are only compatible from python **version 2.7**. If this excludes using the standard python installation of certain OS distributions, you may still install python 2.7 [manually from the download pages]( https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your system. However, this may break other tools in your environment, who need to be consistent with the default python packages. Using [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) to switch between different python installs/environments may help in this case.

3. **pip**

  Make sure that the latest version of [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/) is installed.
  ```
  sudo pip install -U pip
  ```

**Installation**

1. Then install the required system and Python packages and the Nuxeo Drive code itself.

  Debian package manager:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev python-qt4 libffi-dev git
  ```
  Redhat package manager (RPM):
  ```
  sudo yum install python-pip python-devel PyQt4 libffi-devel git
  ```

  Then finally install the Nuxeo Drive requirements and Nuxeo Drive itself. These are common installation actions, not depending on the package manager.
  (warning: define the version you want in the DRIVE_VERSION variable, ex: `release-2.1.113` - [Find the Nuxeo Drive tags list here](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-drive/tags)):
  ```
  # For Drive < 2.2.227:
  DRIVE_VERSION=release-2.1.113
  pip install -r https://raw.github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-drive/$DRIVE_VERSION/requirements.txt
  pip install -r https://raw.github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-drive/$DRIVE_VERSION/unix-requirements.txt
  pip install git+https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-drive.git@$DRIVE_VERSION

  # For Drive >= 2.2.227:
  DRIVE_VERSION=release-2.2.323
  pip install -r https://raw.github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-drive/$DRIVE_VERSION/requirements.txt
  pip install -r https://raw.github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-drive/$DRIVE_VERSION/requirements-unix.txt
  pip install git+https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-drive.git@$DRIVE_VERSION
  ```

2. For now, the systray icon is not visible under Unity desktop. As a consequence, the configuration window only appears at the first launch. If you want to change it, issue the following commands:

    ```
    pkill ndrive
    rm -rf ~/.nuxeo-drive
    ndrive &
    ```

4.  Now configure automatic start and protocol handler:

    ```
    # Install for local user. See $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS for a system wide install
    # Configure Nuxeo Drive to load at startup
    mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
    cat >~/.config/autostart/ndrive.desktop <<EOF
    [Desktop Entry]
    Type=Application
    Exec=ndrive
    Hidden=false
    NoDisplay=false
    X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
    Name[fr_FR]=Nuxeo Drive
    Name=Nuxeo Drive
    Comment[fr_FR]=
    Comment=
    EOF

    # Install for local user. See $XDG_DATA_DIRS for a system wide install
    # Add handler for opening files
    cat >~/.local/share/applications/nxdrive-handler.desktop <<EOF
    [Desktop Entry]
    Type=Application
    Exec=ndrive %u
    Name=Nuxeo Drive Protocol Handler
    GenericName=Nuxeo Drive Handler
    Comment=Handle NXdrive URL
    Terminal=false
    MimeType=x-scheme-handler/nxdrive
    EOF
    update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/
    ```

4.  You now need to [start Nuxeo Drive](#starting-nuxeo-drive) on your computer.
    A `Nuxeo Drive` folder will be created by the system at the root of your local home folder. This is the place where synchronized documents will be stored on your computer.

### Starting Nuxeo Drive

After you installed Nuxeo Drive, you need to start it manually.

Start Nuxeo Drive like any other application:

*   On macOS, Nuxeo Drive is in the Applications directory.

    {{#> callout type='note' }}

    When you double click on the icon, a security message appears. To bypass it, you can modify your security settings or click right on Nuxeo Drive application and click on **Open**.

    ![]({{file name='Drive_Mac_OS_warning.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)

    {{/callout}}
*   On Windows, Nuxeo Drive is started from **Start** > **Programs** > **Nuxeo Drive**.
*   On GNU/Linux, check that `$HOME/.local/bin` is in the `PATH`, then press Alt+F2 and enter `ndrive`.

### Upgrading Nuxeo Drive

When a new version of Nuxeo Drive is available, a message is displayed at the bottom of the systray menu.

1.  Click on the upgrade message at the bottom of the systray menu.
    ![]({{file name='Drive_upgrade_available.png'}} ?w=200,border=true,thumbnail=true)
2.  If you want Nuxeo Drive to update silently the next time, check the box **Automatically update Drive** in the **General** tab.
    ![]({{file name='Drive-Settings.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)
3.  Click on the green icon.
    Nuxeo Drive is updated and automatically restarted.
    ![]({{file name='Drive_update_in_progress.png'}} ?w=200,border=true,thumbnail=true)

## Configuration

### Settings

{{> anchor 'open-drive-settings'}} **Accessing the Settings Window**

**On Windows**

1.  Right-click on the the icon ![]({{file name='drive_online.png' page='nuxeo-drive'}}) in the systray.
2.  Click on the icon ![]({{file name='drive-settings-icon.png' page='nuxeo-drive'}}) and on the **Settings** menu item.
    The Settings window is displayed.

**On macOS / GNU/Linux**

1.  Click on the the icon ![]({{file name='drive_online.png' page='nuxeo-drive'}}) in the systray.
2.  Click on the icon ![]({{file name='drive-settings-icon.png' page='nuxeo-drive'}}) and on the **Settings** menu item.
    The Settings window is displayed.

The Nuxeo Drive settings window shows four tabs that enable you to customize the behavior of your Nuxeo Drive:

*   **General**
    This is where you select the general behavior of your Nuxeo Drive: what language to use, the update policy, etc.
    ![]({{file name='Drive-Settings.png'}} ?w=400,border=true)
*   **Accounts**
    Set up one or several Nuxeo Platform accounts to synchronize with Nuxeo Drive.

    Information about the Nuxeo Drive version and license.
    ![]({{file name='drive_About_tab.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)

### Managing Local Nuxeo Drive Accounts

You can use Nuxeo Drive to synchronize content from several Nuxeo Platform applications. This means that you can set up several accounts on Nuxeo Drive. Accounts are managed from the **Accounts** tab of the [Settings window](#open-drive-settings).

#### Adding a New Account

When you add a new account you need to provide the following information:

*   **Name**: Give a name to the Nuxeo Drive account you are setting.
    This is helpful when you use Nuxeo Drive with several applications.
*   **Folder**: Select where you want your Nuxeo Drive folder to be created.
*   **URL**: Type the URL of your Nuxeo application, with the `/nuxeo` suffix (`http://NUXEO_SERVER/nuxeo` for instance).
*   **Username**: Type your username to the Nuxeo Platform application.
*   **Password**: Type your password to the Nuxeo Platform application.

The creation of a new account triggers the following actions:

*   A Nuxeo Drive folder is created at the location you chose (see section [Accessing the Nuxeo Drive Folder](#access-local-drive-folder)).
*   Nuxeo Drive starts synchronizing the Nuxeo workspaces or folders you [indicated as synchronized](#synchronizing-workspaces-root) in the Nuxeo Platform. It will automatically update content when there is a modification on the server.
*   In the **Nuxeo Drive** tab in your **Home**, an authentication token corresponding to the computer you are synchronizing from is displayed. The list of synchronized folders is displayed in the **Synchronization roots** section of the tab.
    ![]({{file name='drive-newtab.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)

#### Deleting an Account

You can delete accounts from your Nuxeo Drive at any time by clicking on the **Delete account** button of the corresponding account, in the **Settings** window. The local Nuxeo Drive folder is not deleted.

### Changing the Nuxeo Drive Language

By default, Nuxeo Drive is available in English and in French.

**To change the language of Nuxeo Drive:**

1.  Open the Nuxeo Drive Settings window.
2.  Click on the **General** tab.
3.  In the **Language** drop down list, select the language you want to use.
    The Settings window language is immediately changed.

### Nuxeo Drive and Audit Logs

Nuxeo Drive makes an extensive use of audit logs to get a summary of the server-side changes.

Since Nuxeo Platform 7.3 we chose to use Elasticsearch as a default back end for audit logs. This improves scalability especially when using Nuxeo Drive with a large set of users.

That's why we **strongly recommend to keep** this default configuration, but you can still [disable Elasticsearch for Audit Logs]({{page page='elasticsearch-setup'}}#disabling-elasticsearch-for-audit-logs).
