<span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);text-decoration: none;">Due to a change in Atlassian's JIRA licensing, we are no longer able to allow everyone to open an account on [jira.nuxeo.com](http://jira.nuxeo.com). This means that only active JIRA users will keep an open account. All other accounts will be deactivated and migrated to a &ldquo;community bot&rdquo; user.</span>

<span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);text-decoration: none;">We consider active JIRA users to be those who have opened more than 2 tickets in the past year.</span>
<span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);text-decoration: none;">Don't worry, you will still be able to send us your feedback and open tickets. To do that, you will just have to go to [answers.nuxeo.com](http://answers.nuxeo.com). Start by creating a question and you&rsquo;ll get an answer from Nuxeo. We'll help you qualify the bug. Once it's qualified, you will be able to click on the &ldquo;Report a bug&rdquo; button.</span>

<span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);text-decoration: none;">We apologize for the inconvenience this may cause, but we hope this becomes an opportunity to regroup the community on [answers.nuxeo.com](http://answers.nuxeo.com).</span>
