This how-to is the first step of the tutorial Getting Started with the Nuxeo Platform, allowing you to explore the Nuxeo Platform through its REST API.</br>
It provides instructions for installing and running a Nuxeo Platform instance using Docker or the ZIP package.

## Docker

### Installation

Follow the installation steps described in the [Docker installation documentation page]({{page version='' space='nxdoc' page='docker-image'}}#running-the-image).

### Setting up Environment

You now have a Nuxeo Platform instance ready to run. At this step, you need to install some addons, in particular the addon Getting started with the Nuxeo Platform.

The addon Getting started with the Nuxeo Platform will add some business logic and documents to your Nuxeo Platform instance, that we will leverage all through this tutorial.

{{#> callout type='warning' heading='PRIVATE IMAGE'}}
You should contact your Nuxeo Administrator or Nuxeo sales representative to get access to this image.
{{/callout}}

1.  Log into `docker-private.packages.nuxeo.com`:

    ```
    $ docker login docker-private.packages.nuxeo.com -u <username> -p <token_pass_code>
    ```

1. Install the addons required for this tutorial and start Nuxeo in development mode:
  {{#> callout type='warning' heading='Dev Mode'}}
  Running Nuxeo in DEV MODE is insecure and not production-ready, and should only be used for local development purposes.
  {{/callout}}

    ```
    $ docker run --name nuxeo \
      -e NUXEO_CLID="<NUXEO_CLID>" \
      -e NUXEO_DEV=true \
      -p 8080:8080 \
      -e NUXEO_PACKAGES="nuxeo-web-ui nuxeo-platform-getting-started" \
      docker-private.packages.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/nuxeo:2021
    ```

Your server is now running. You benefit from the [features](#content-of-the-getting-started-addon) brought by the addon Getting started with the Nuxeo Platform.

### Going further with Nuxeo Docker deployment

- If you're not familiar with Docker images and containers, we recommend you to use the [CTOP](https://github.com/bcicen/ctop) utility, which provides a concise and condensed overview of real-time metrics for multiple containers, with the ability to start, stop, delete and view logs for each container.
- It is recommended to use Docker Compose to run Nuxeo with Docker: you can find an example in the [Nuxeo Sandbox GitHub repository](https://github.com/nuxeo-sandbox/nuxeo-presales-docker).
- You can easily customize the Nuxeo Docker Image by building a Docker image from the Nuxeo one: read the [Build a Custom Docker Image]({{page version='cloud' space='nxdoc' page='build-a-custom-docker-image'}}) documentation page.

## Universal ZIP Package

Contrarily to the Docker image, the universal ZIP package comes without the related software needed for this tutorial. Please [install and set up related software]({{page page='installing-and-setting-up-related-software'}}) before going to the next step.

{{{multiexcerpt 'lts2023-general-prerequisites' space='nxdoc' page='generic-multi-excerpts'}}}

### Installation

1.  Unzip the ZIP distribution from [Nuxeo Connect Distribution section](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/connect/distributions).
2.  Register your Nuxeo instance on Nuxeo Online Services:

    ```
    # Linux and macOS
    $ ./$NUXEO_HOME/bin/nuxeoctl register

    # Windows
    $ .\$NUXEO_HOME\bin\nuxeoctl.bat register
    ```

    And follow the instructions displayed.

### Setting up Environment

You now have a Nuxeo Platform instance ready to run. In this step, you need to install some addons, in particular the addon Getting started with the Nuxeo Platform.

The addon Getting started with the Nuxeo Platform will add some business logic and documents to your Nuxeo Platform instance which we will leverage throughout this tutorial.

To install a Nuxeo Package:

1.  Get the list of local Nuxeo addons.

    ```
    # Linux and macOS
    $ ./nuxeoctl mp-list

    # Windows
    $ .\nuxeoctl.bat mp-list
    ```

    You get a list of the local addons that have been downloaded.

2.  Install the addons required for this tutorial.

    ```
    # Linux and macOS
    $ ./nuxeoctl mp-install nuxeo-web-ui nuxeo-platform-getting-started

    # Windows
    $ .\nuxeoctl.bat mp-install nuxeo-web-ui nuxeo-platform-getting-started
    ```

3.  Validate the dependency resolution step.

    ```
    Dependency resolution:
      Installation order (2):        nuxeo-web-ui-3.0.2/nuxeo-platform-getting-started-2021.0.0
      Packages to download (2):      nuxeo-web-ui:3.0.2, nuxeo-platform-getting-started:2021.0.0

    Do you want to continue (yes/no)? [yes]
    ```

4.  Check that the Nuxeo addons were correctly installed.

    ```
    # Linux and macOS
    $ ./nuxeoctl mp-list
    [...]
    Local packages:
       addon     started	nuxeo-platform-getting-started (id: nuxeo-platform-getting-started-2021.0.0)
       addon     started	nuxeo-web-ui (id: nuxeo-web-ui-3.0.2)

    # Windows
    $ .\nuxeoctl.bat mp-list
    [...]
    Local packages:
       addon     started	nuxeo-platform-getting-started (id: nuxeo-platform-getting-started-2021.0.0)
       addon     started	nuxeo-web-ui (id: nuxeo-web-ui-3.0.2)
    ```

    The installed addons now have the status 'started'.

5.  Start the server.

    ```
    # Linux and macOS
    $ ./nuxeoctl start

    # Windows
    $ .\nuxeoctl.bat start
    ```

    Your server is now running with the addon Getting started with the Nuxeo Platform.

## Content of the Getting Started Addon

Once installed, the addon brings the following document types:
{{! multiexcerpt name='studio_configuration_desc'}}
- The portfolio document type (`BCPortfolio`) holds the contracts of a customer. Its holds properties about the customer: the company name, industry and size, and the customer's juridical contact information.
- The contract document type (`BCContract`) have several properties: an owner (an application user), some dates (signature, start, expiration dates), a type, an amount. It inherits customer information from its portfolio.
- Some vocabularies are used to populate the portfolio and contract metadata (`companySize`, `contractType` and `industry`)
- Contracts have a specific lifecycle, so they can evolve though the states `draft`, `approval`, `running`, `renegociation` and `void`
- Some business logic through automation chains and event handlers make contracts inherit properties from its portfolio, and evolve following its lifecycle{{! /multiexcerpt}}
