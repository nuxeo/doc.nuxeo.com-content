{{! excerpt}}

Nuxeo Studio is a very powerful tool. The direct consequence is that there are very often several solutions to one problematic. This section aims at providing tooltips to help you choosing the right solution depending on your needs.

*   [Locking vs Permission to Restrict Edit Access to a Document]({{page space='NXDOC' page='Locking vs+Permission+to+Restrict+Edit+Access+to+a+Document'}})&nbsp;&mdash; During the life of a document, on state changes, or during a workflow for instance, it is sometimes required that a document has restricted modification permissions. There are at least two ways of doing this in Nuxeo.
*   [Several Document Types vs One Document Type with a Nature Metadata]({{page space='NXDOC' page='Several Document+Types+vs+One+Document+Type+with+a+Nature+Metadata'}})&nbsp;&mdash; In some cases, there is a need to manage different documents (procedure, instruction, notice, invoices...) but with very similar properties and lifecycles.
