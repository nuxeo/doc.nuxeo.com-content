The Nuxeo JavaScript Client is a JavaScript client library for the Nuxeo Automation and REST API.
The library can work in a browser, or in Node.js, using the same API.
In this tutorial you will use the Node.js to discover the features of Nuxeo Platform.
If you want to get an overview about the JavaScript client, read the [Nuxeo JavaScript Client]({{page page='JavaScript Client'}}) page.

## Setting up the JavaScript Environment

2. Create a folder called `nuxeo_tutorial` on your computer.

3. Open a terminal and go that folder.
    ```
    $ cd nuxeo_tutorial
    ```
4. Use 'npm' to install the Nuxeo JavaScript Client package.
    ```
    $ npm install nuxeo@2.x
    ```
    A `node_modules` folder is now available in `nuxeo_tutorial`.
