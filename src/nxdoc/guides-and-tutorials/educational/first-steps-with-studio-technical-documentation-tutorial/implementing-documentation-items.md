The goal is to manage all kinds of documents like procedures or notices. At this first step, we will create a new document type called `documentationItem`. This documentation item will be the main document type we will be using in our project. We will use the Nature metadata to differentiate the different kinds of documentation items. See the page [Several Document Types vs One Document Type with a Nature Metadata]({{page page='several-document-types-vs-one-document-type-with-a-nature-metadata'}}) for more information.

## Before You Start

We recommend you first take a look at the [Repository Concepts]({{page page='repository-concepts'}}) page if you are not yet familiar with the Nuxeo Platform.

{{! multiexcerpt name='tuto-item-names-warning'}}

In this section we provide example names for items. You'll see different names in screen shots. Most of the time a suffix like "tuto" is added. In your Studio project please use the suggested names (or invent your own) and not the ones in screen shots.

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

## Declaring the Documentation Item Document Type

**To create the documentationItem document type:**

1.  In Nuxeo Studio, go in **Content Model** > **Document Types**.
2.  Click on **New**.
3.  Type the feature ID (i.e. the document type name in Studio): `documentationItem`.
4.  In the **Extends** field, select **File**.
    We need to have something holding a binary file with metadata, life cycle, version and validation. This is very similar to the File document type.
5.  Type a label for the end user in the Nuxeo Platform: `Technical documentation item`.
6.  Click on **Next**.
    ![]({{file page='/nxdoc/implementing-documentation-items' name='new_document_type_popup.png'}} ?w=500,h=353,border=true)
    The `documentationItem` document type is created.

**Check your changes on the Nuxeo Platform:**

1.  Go to your Nuxeo Platform and [deploy]({{page space='studio' page='deploying-your-project-in-dev-mode'}}) your project.
2.  On the Nuxeo Platform interface, go in a workspace and click on **New**.
    You should see **Technical documentation item** in the Miscellaneous category.
    ![]({{file name='newAvailableDocType-2.png'}} ?w=550,border=true)

The new document type is created, it is now time to customize it.

## Defining Properties and Facets

Let's define some properties of the `documentationItem`.

1.  In Studio go back on the `documentationItem` **Definition** tab.
2.  Select the category **Document**.
    This will make the document type be displayed in the Document category in the Nuxeo Platform Available Document Types popup instead of Miscellaneous.
3.  Choose [icons]({{page space='studio' page='resources'}}).
4.  Leave all other values as they are for now.
5.  Click on **Save**.
    The documentation item is now available in the correct category and it has some icons. But it does not hold the needed informations (process, nature, binary...).

**Notes**:

*   Take a look at the facets. The ones we are interested in are already selected and grayed out: versionable, can be published. This is because the `DocumentationItem` inherits the File document type facets.

**Read More:**

*   [Available Facets]({{page page='available-facets'}})
*   [Resources in Studio]({{page space='studio' page='resources'}})

## Defining the Metadata

To be able to describe and find the document, the following metadata should be available on the document:

*   The usual descriptive information (title, description, creation date, creator...)
*   A nature: a simple and limited list of choices
*   A process: a two level list of choices. Since there can be many processes we will group them by category.
*   A binary file (Word, PDF...): the attachment that will be the actual content. On the Nuxeo Platform, binary files are "just another metadata" with a specific type (blob).

### Checking Inherited Schemas

In the Nuxeo Platform metadata are always grouped by schemas. A schema is a set of metadata that make sense together. A document very often has several schemas of metadata. In Studio, look at the bottom of the **Schema** tab: there are already several inherited schemas. Once again, this is because `DocumentationItem` extends `File`.

![]({{file page='/nxdoc/implementing-documentation-items' name='inheritedSchemas-2.png'}} ?w=550,border=true)

*   `common` and `uid` are schemas used by the system.
*   `file` is a schema defined to hold a binary file. This exactly what we need.
*   `files` enables to hold other binaries (like attached files). This could be useful for the annexes of the `documentationItem` for instance.
*   `dublincore` is a standard schema that holds descriptive information like title, creator...

In the end we need two metadata: "nature" and "process". So let's create them in Studio.

### Creating the Quality Schema

1.  Click on **Content Model** > **Schemas**.
2.  Click on the **New** button.
    ![]({{file page='/nxdoc/implementing-documentation-items' name='genericSchema.png'}} ?w=500,border=true)
3.  Name the schema `quality` as processes are often managed by quality departments.
4.  Choose a shorter name for the prefix: `qa`.
5.  Click on **Next** to validate the schema creation.
    The schema is created. It is empty for now.

**Note:** In Studio, each document type has its own dedicated schema, that you can define from the **Schema** tab. The "process" metadata can be a generic metadata in a technical documentation management app. So we create a generic schema in the **Schemas** item on the menu of Nuxeo Studio instead of using the default `documentationItem` **Schema** tab.

### Adding Metadata to the Schema

1.  Add a new field and name it `process`.
2.  Select the **String** type.
    ![]({{file page='/nxdoc/implementing-documentation-items' name='schema_field.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)

3.  Add a new field and name it `nature`.
4.  Select the **String** type.
5.  Click on **Save**.
    The schema now holds two metadata.

**Note:** A document is only related to one process and one nature, so we do not check **Multi-Valued**. We don't want the documentationItems to have a default process or nature value either.

### Adding the Schema to the documentationItem Document Type

Now you add this new schema to the `DocumentationItem` document type:

1.  Go back to the **Schema** tab of the document type.
2.  In the **Add extra schemas to this document type** form, select the `quality` schema in the left list.
3.  Add it to the right list.
    ![]({{file page='/nxdoc/implementing-documentation-items' name='inheritSchema.png'}} ?w=500,border=true)
4.  Click on **Save**.
    The schema is now available on the document type. So every metadata added to the schema will automatically be added to the document.

Nuxeo makes a difference between the content model (what are the document types and metadata?) and the user interface. The metadata is available on the document but we haven't defined how to fill in this metadata.

## Showing Metadata in the User Interface

Metadata are displayed in [form layouts]({{page space='studio' page='form-layouts'}}). A form layout can be generic and reused by several documents or it can be specific to a document type. In our example, we will change the specific layouts of our document type.

1.  Go on the `DocumentationItem` definition.
    Four layout tabs are available. Each layout corresponds to a way to access the document: creation, view, edition. You can then control what can be seen and modified. The header layout is what you see on the top of the document. We will leave it empty, and it will take the default layout that displays the title of the document.
2.  Click on the **Creation Layout** tab.
    You can see that the layout is already filled with a minimum set of metadata.
3.  Click on the icon ![]({{file name='delete.gif' space='studio' page='studio-icons-index'}}) of the WARNING row and confirm deletion.
4.  Select the `quality` schema in the right drop down list.
    ![]({{file page='/nxdoc/implementing-documentation-items' name='creation_layout_schemas_list.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)
5.  Drag the `Process` metadata from the list and drop it on a row of the layout.
    The widget edition pop-up displays several options for the widget you just dropped.
6.  Leave the default values for now, and click on **Save**.
7.  Click on the **Add Row** button to add two new rows to the layout.
8.  In the `quality` schema, drag and drop the `Nature` metadata on a row and save default values.
9.  In the `file` schema, drag and drop the `content` metadata and save default values.
10.  Click on **Save**.
    In the end you should have a creation layout looking like:
    ![]({{file page='/nxdoc/implementing-documentation-items' name='creation_layout.png'}} ?w=500,h=273,border=true)
    Which will give, once deployed on the server:
    ![]({{file name='creation_layout_result.png'}} ?w=400,border=true)

Next, let's make Nature and Process lists of choices and not simple text boxes.

### Showing a List of Choices in the UI for a Metadata

In the Nuxeo Platform lists of choices are called vocabularies. A [specific section]({{page space='studio' page='vocabularies'}}) is available in Studio for them.

#### Creating the Nature List

1.  In Studio, go in the **Vocabularies** section.
2.  [Create a new vocabulary]({{page page='how-to-add-a-new-vocabulary'}}) : call it it `qualNat` and select **Simple Vocabulary**.
3.  Add a few entries. Ids are for the system, labels will be displayed to the final user.
    In the end, you should have something like:
    ![]({{file page='/nxdoc/implementing-documentation-items' name='vocabulary_definition_nature.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)

#### Creating the Process List

1.  Create a new vocabulary: call it `procQual` and select the type **Hierarchical Vocabulary**.
    We need a two-level vocabulary as they are processes and sub-processes.
2.  Click on **Add Root** and **Add Child** to create processes and sub-processes.
    In the end, you can have something like that (please note that these are dummy processes):
    ![]({{file page='/nxdoc/implementing-documentation-items' name='vocabulary_definition_process.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)

Now that you have the two vocabularies, you still have to bind them to the metadata so that the user can select them. This is where we will customize each metadata widget in the creation layout from a simple text to list of choices.

#### Configuring the Nature Widget

1.  Go back to the creation layout of `DocumentationItem`.
2.  Edit the `Nature` metadata widget by clicking on the icon ![]({{file name='editor_area.gif' space='studio' page='studio-icons-index'}}).
3.  In the Layout Widget Editor, select the widget type ****Single directory suggestion**** .
4.  In the **Edit properties** part, select the vocabulary `qualNat`.
5.  You can make the nature field required if you want to by selecting **Yes** in the **Required** drop down list.
    ![]({{file page='/nxdoc/implementing-documentation-items' name='widget_editor_nature.png'}} ?w=450,border=true)
6.  Click on **Save**.

#### Configuring the **Process Widget**

1.  Edit the `Process` widget.
2.  In the Layout Widget Editor, select the widget type **Single directory suggestion**.
3.  Select the vocabulary `procQual`.
    ![]({{file page='/nxdoc/implementing-documentation-items' name='widget_editor_process.png'}} ?w=400,border=true)
4.  Click on **Save**.
    The Creation Layout is now fully configured.

## Applying the Creation Layout Configuration to Other Layouts

1.  Click on the View Layout tab, and click on **Import Layout** > **Import 'create' layout**.
    It imports what you did on the creation layout, so that you are able to see on the **Summary** tab the metadata of your document.
    ![]({{file page='/nxdoc/implementing-documentation-items' name='import_layout_button.png'}} ?w=500,border=true)
2.  Do the same thing on the **Edit Layout** tab.
3.  Click on **Save**.

## Testing Your Changes

1.  [Redeploy your customization]({{page space='studio' page='deploying-your-project-in-dev-mode'}}) the server.
2.  Create a new Technical Documentation Item.
    ![]({{file name='creation_layout_result_2.png'}} ?w=450,border=true)

{{#> callout type='tip' heading='Congratulation'}}

You created a document type that will hold all the information you need to manage your technical documentation items.

To sum up, what we saw:

*   A document type can have metadata of several types (String, Integer...).
*   Metadata are grouped in schemas. Of course, one document can have several schemas.
*   The content model is different from the user interface. When you add a metadata to a document (through its schemas), you have to add the metadata in the layouts of the document.
*   You can control how the metadata are filled in directly from the layouts of the document by changing the widget type.

The next step is to adapt where the documents are created and how they are displayed when browsing.
