## Themes

Nuxeo Web UI provides several themes to change the look and feel of the UI. For the moment, they mostly provide color schemes applied to UI elements and a background image for some themes.

The available themes are:
- default
- dark
- light
- garden
- kawaii

### Customization

In the current version it's not possible to contribute new themes, however the existing ones can be overridden with a contribution.

To customize one of the provided themes you can simply deploy and override theme resources as described in [How to deploy additional Web UI resources]({{page page='web-ui-deployment#deploy_or_override'}}).

Taking `resources/web/nuxeo.war/ui/` as our base path, these are the available resources for each theme:

- `/styles/{name}-theme.html` style definitions that allow customizing colors, fonts, or any other CSS properties for most elements used in the Web UI.
- `/images/themes/{name}-theme.jpg` preview image that is displayed on the themes chooser page.
- `/images/themes/{name}.png` image used as background (available for some themes only).

Besides the background images `/images/themes/{name}.png` you can also add any images to `/images/themes/` and reference them in your `/styles/{name}-theme.html` styles resources.

### How to Customize a Theme

This example provides an walk-through on how to override the `light` theme in Web UI.

{{#> panel type='code' heading='Without any customization the theme looks like this:'}}
![]({{file name='light-theme.png'}} ?w=800,border=true)
{{/panel}}

Make a local copy of the theme `/styles/light-theme.html` then make the following changes to it:

{{#> panel type='code' heading='Change default font import from `Roboto` to `Gabriela`'}}
```css
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Gabriela" rel="stylesheet">
```
{{/panel}}

{{#> panel type='code' heading='Then change the `--nuxeo-app-font` accordingly'}}
```css
<style is="custom-style">
  ...
  :root {
    --nuxeo-app-font: 'Gabriela', Arial, sans-serif;
    ...
   }
   ...
</style>

```
{{/panel}}


{{#> panel type='code' heading='Change background to use a custom image'}}
```css
  html, body {
    ...
    background: url(../images/themes/custom-background.jpg) repeat;
    ...
  }
```
{{/panel}}


{{#> callout type='note'}}
The image `custom-background.jpg` needs to be contributed to `/images/themes/` in your bundle so it can be referenced in styles.
{{/callout}}


{{#> panel type='code' heading='Change some colors'}}
```css
  :root {
    ...
    --nuxeo-badge-background: Tomato;
    ...
    --nuxeo-header-background: #CFD8DC;
    ...
    --nuxeo-sidebar-background: #58597a;
    ...
    --nuxeo-button-primary: Tomato;
    ...
  }
```
{{/panel}}

{{#> panel type='code' heading='After customization the `light` theme will look like this:'}}
![]({{file name='custom-theme.png'}} ?w=800,border=true)
{{/panel}}

Finally you just need to contribute the preview image (that appears in the `Themes` page in the Web UI) with the same name as the theme being overridden, in this case `/images/themes/light-theme.jpg`.

{{#> callout type='warning'}}

Note that we are making some improvements in themes and styling in general.
The process to make contributions related to themes customization are subject to change until the release of a later Web UI version.
