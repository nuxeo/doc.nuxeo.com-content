Nuxeo integrates the Seam library. However, this library has a feature that Nuxeo doesn't use and that is vulnerable to a Remote Code Execution.

We highly recommend you to apply the following hotfixes to your distribution:
- [Nuxeo 7.10 HF38](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-7.10-HF38)
- [Nuxeo 8.10 HF26](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-8.10-HF26)
- [Nuxeo 9.10 HF03](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-9.10-HF03)

If you cannot update to the latest hotfix, use a Fast Track version or use an old version of Nuxeo Platform >= 6.0, the workaround is to update the Seam JAR library

[jboss-seam-2.3.1.Final.NX03.jar](https://maven.nuxeo.org/nexus/service/local/repositories/vendor-releases/content/org/jboss/seam/jboss-seam/2.3.1.Final.NX03/jboss-seam-2.3.1.Final.NX03.jar)

You need to remove all occurrences of the previous package of `jboss-seam-2.*.jar`

```bash
# In your Nuxeo folder, this will delete all seam jar
find . -name jboss-seam-2.*.jar -delete
# Download the JAR from internet
cd nxserver/lib
wget https://maven.nuxeo.org/nexus/service/local/repositories/vendor-releases/content/org/jboss/seam/jboss-seam/2.3.1.Final.NX03/jboss-seam-2.3.1.Final.NX03.jar
```
