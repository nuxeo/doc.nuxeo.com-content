Nuxeo integrates the JSF library.  One JSF page allows Expression Language injection which can lead to a Remote Code Execution.

We highly recommend you to apply the following hotfixes to your distribution:

- [Nuxeo 7.10 HF45](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-7.10-HF45)
- [Nuxeo 8.10 HF36](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-8.10-HF36)
- [Nuxeo 9.10 HF17](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-9.10-HF17)

If you cannot update to the latest hotfix, use a Fast Track version or use an old version of Nuxeo Platform >= 6.0, the workaround is to blacklist the $ within URL.


Here is an Apache configuration file example:

```bash
RewriteCond "%{REQUEST_URI}"  "^/nuxeo/.*\$.*$"
RewriteRule ".*" "" [F]
```
