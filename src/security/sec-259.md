Nuxeo integrates the RichFaces library. However, this library has a feature that Nuxeo doesn't use and that is vulnerable to a Remote Code Execution.

We highly recommend you to apply the following hotfixes to your distribution:
- [Nuxeo 7.10 HF42](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-7.10-HF42)
- [Nuxeo 8.10 HF32](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-8.10-HF32)
- [Nuxeo 9.10 HF11](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-9.10-HF11)

If you cannot update to the latest hotfix, use a Fast Track version or use an old version of Nuxeo Platform >= 6.0, the workaround is to blacklist the vulnerable servlet with url:

`/nuxeo/rfRes/org.richfaces.resource.MediaOutputResource.jsf`

Here is an Apache configuration file example:

```bash
RewriteCond "%{REQUEST_URI}"  "^/nuxeo/rfRes/org.richfaces.resource.MediaOutputResource.jsf.*$"
RewriteRule ".*" "" [F,L]
```
