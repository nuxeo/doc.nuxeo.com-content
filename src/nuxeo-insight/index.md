**Nuxeo Insight** applies **Machine Learning** to your content, uses your content as a dataset and predicts your taxonomies and ontologies. It **understands your content** and **generates your business-specific metadata** providing critical data to your **searches**, your **processes** and your **use cases**.

## Overview

Understand how we achieve business-specific AI and how Nuxeo Insight is Enterprise Ready.</br>
See the [overview]({{page version='' space='nuxeo-insight' page='overview'}}) page for more information.

## Working With Content Bots

As a domain expert you know your content, that's all that's needed, no Machine Learning expertise required.

- First step is to experiment and create your content bots.
- You can then manage, monitor them and their evolution.
- As you publish and use them you have full control on this governance.

## Active Improvements

Evolving content bots is a critical aspect of improving their ROI.
This is achieved by adding more content and annotating it with the **human in the loop**. Nevertheless, we use **active learning** to optimize human participation and make it as productive and efficient as we can.
Also, as not all performance aspects are on the same level, we let you decide what metadata is your priority and focus specifically on those, allowing a rapid evolution on what is **important for your business**.
