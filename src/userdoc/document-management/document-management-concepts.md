### Workspaces

Collaborative work takes place in **workspaces**, where users can [create]({{page page='creating-content'}}) and [edit documents]({{page page='editing-content'}}). [Workspaces]({{page page='working-in-workspaces'}}) are designed to make capture, sharing and editing of documents easier using desktop integration features, [comments]({{page page='comments'}}), [annotations]({{page page='annotations-and-preview'}}). In the mean time, [documents history and versioning]({{page page='documents-history'}}), [relations]({{page page='relations'}}), [workflows]({{page page='workflows'}}) and [alerts]({{page page='alerts'}}) enable you to build a coherent and controlled documents structure.

### Templates

To help users create the workspaces in which they work, you can create workspaces **templates** and prepare the structure that will be applied to workspaces used in [template-based workspaces]({{page page='creating-a-workspace#template-based-workspace-creation'}}).

### Sections

When documents are finished and ready, they are published in **sections**. Traditionally opened to a wider audience than workspaces, sections are dedicated to content distribution and communication and are designed for content consultation. That is why users cannot change documents (edit or move them) in sections: documents published in sections are frozen versions of workspace documents.[ Publishing]({{page page='publishing-documents'}}) is controlled using a workflow, that requires publishing requests to be [approved]({{page page='publishing-documents#approve-document-publishing'}}) so documents can be seen in sections.

### Domains

Sections, workspaces and templates are grouped in **domains**. A domain can be considered as a mini-application in Nuxeo or a root in the application. Typically, you can use domains to open the application to two or more very different populations of users. For instance, you can have an "intranet" domain and an "extranet" domain. Domains can be totally independent or not, depending on the access rights you set on each domain.

## Access Rights {{> anchor 'rights'}}

Access to documents and the actions allowed are determined by access rights. Some users will then be allowed to only read documents, when others will be able to edit documents or to manage spaces and documents.

The available access rights are:

&nbsp;

</td><td colspan="1">

{{#> callout type='tip' }}

The "Can ask for publishing" permission is intended to be denied, so as to restrict the actions available to users with "Read" permission, typically to enable users to see the content of a section without being able to publish in the section.

{{/callout}}</td></tr></tbody></table>{{! /excerpt}}

Access rights are given on folderish spaces (workspaces, sections, templates, domains, but also folders, picture books, forum) and are inherited in the sub-spaces.

{{#> callout type='info' }}

On a standard Nuxeo application, members are all granted "read" right at the application's root by default.

{{/callout}}

## Groups of Users

{{! multiexcerpt name='groups-intro'}}

To make access rights management easier, you can [create groups of users]({{page page='managing-users-and-groups'}}). Instead of giving (or denying) access rights to single users and repeat the same operations several times, you can give several users the same right in one single manipulation by using a group.

Default groups are:

*   **members**: users in this group are the end-users users of the application.
*   **power users**: users in this group are the functional administrators of the application. They have a restricted access to the Admin Center, the administration user interface of the Nuxeo Platform, from which they can manage users and groups, edit the vocabularies and define the default dashboard of users.
*   **administrators**: users in this group are the technical administrators of the application. They have access to all the Admin Center features and are in charge of managing the application. Beside the functional administration features, they can edit the application configuration, install packages on the application, consult the application's statistics, restart the server, etc.

{{#> callout type='info' heading='Default groups'}}

Users must be in one of the groups "members" or "administrators" to be able to access content. Power users must be in both the "power users" and "members" groups.

{{/callout}}{{! /multiexcerpt}}

You can [create]({{page page='managing-users-and-groups'}}) as many groups as needed.
