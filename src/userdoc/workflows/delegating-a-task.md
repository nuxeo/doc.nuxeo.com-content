<span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">When you know you might not be able to perform a task, you can delegate it to another user or group of users. Delegating means that they can do the task at your place, but you are not unassigned the task. As soon as you or a delegatee reviews the document, the task is closed for you and all the delegatees. On the contrary, if you do the task before the delegatees, the task is considered done for everyone.</span>

{{{multiexcerpt 'delegate-vs-reassign' page='Reassigning a Task'}}}

You can delegate a task from:

*   The Process view of the tasks in the Home Workflow tab,

    The delegation form is displayed in a pop-up.
    ![]({{file name='delegation-form.png'}} ?w=450,border=true)
3.  In the Users field, type the name of a user or group.
4.  Click on the user or group you want to delegate the task to.
5.  Optionally repeat these steps as many times as you want to delegate the task.
6.  Optionally type a comment for the delegatees.
7.  Click on the&nbsp;**Delegate**&nbsp;button.
    You are displayed the&nbsp;**My tasks**&nbsp;tab of the&nbsp;**Workflow**&nbsp;tab.
