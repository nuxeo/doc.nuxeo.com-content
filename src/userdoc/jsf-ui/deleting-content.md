### Deleting Documents

Only users with "Edit" or "Manage everything" permissions can delete documents from a space.

To delete one or several documents, select them from the **Content** tab of the workspace, click on **Delete** and confirm. The documents are moved to the **Trash** tab of the workspace (available to users with management rights only) and do not appear in the workspace's content list anymore. Their lifecycle state is now "deleted".

You can also delete documents using right-click on the document's icon from the **Content** tab of the workspace.

![]({{file name='right-click-menu.png' space='userdoc' page='editing-content'}} ?w=350,border=true)

### Managing Deleted Documents

Users with "Manage everything" permissions can access the workspace's **Trash** and perform one of the following actions:

*   Restore documents by selecting them and clicking the **Restore** button.
    Documents are moved back to the **Content** tab of the workspace and available to users. They get the "project" lifecycle state, even if their lifecycle state before deletion was "approved".
    ![]({{file name='trash-tab.png' space='userdoc' page='deleting-content'}} ?w=600,border=true)
*   Erase documents by selecting them and clicking the **Permanent delete** button.
    Documents are permanently erased from the application. They cannot be restored. The [relations]({{page space='userdoc' page='editing-content#relations'}}) to the deleted documents are deleted.
    ![]({{file name='trash-tab.png' space='userdoc' page='deleting-content'}} ?w=600,border=true)
*   Empty the trash by clicking the corresponding button.
    All deleted documents are permanently erased from the application. They cannot be restored. The [relations]({{page space='userdoc' page='editing-content#relations'}}) to the deleted documents are deleted.
    ![]({{file name='empty-trash.png' space='userdoc' page='deleting-content'}} ?w=500,h=179,border=true)
