If you think that you should not be responsible for a task, you can reassign it. Reassignment should not be confused with delegation.

{{{multiexcerpt 'delegate-vs-reassign' page='Reassigning a Task'}}}

You can reassign a task from the Task tab.

**To reassign a task from the Tasks tab:**

1. Click on the task to you want to reassign.
1. Click on **Start Review**.
![]({{file name='reassign-delegate.png'}} ?w=500,border=true)
1. Click on **Reassign**.
The Reassignment form is displayed in a pop-up.
![]({{file name='reassign-choose-users.png'}} ?w=500,border=true)
1. In the Users field, type the name of a user or group.
1. Click on the user or group you want to reassign the task to.
1. Optional: Repeat these steps as many times as you want to reassign the task.
1. Optional: Type a comment for the assignee(s).
1. Click on the **Reassign** button.
The task is no longer  displayed in your Tasks tab.
