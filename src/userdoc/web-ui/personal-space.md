The personal workspace menu gives you a direct access to your collections and personal documents. Personal spaces can only be accessed by their owner, by default. You can of course share the access to your personal space with other users.

Content creation and edition, as well as management, works the same way in personal space as in workspaces.

## Creating Personal Documents

To create personal documents, follow the same steps as for [any other documents]({{page page ='browse'}}#creating-content) and it will be displayed in your personal space.

## Accessing Favorites

A **My Favorites** folder lets you access to your favorites and manage them. Read the [Favorites]({{page page='favorites'}}) documentation page for more information.

## Accessing Collections

A **My Collections** folder lets you access to the collections you have access to and the ones you created.
Read the [Collections]({{page page='collections-web-ui'}}) documentation page for more information.
