## Analytics

Analytics enable administrators to consult information and statistics on how the application is used:


- **Document Distribution**: Provides statistics on the documents types, their size and counts.

- **Repository Content**: Provides statistics on the repository, such as the top downloads, the number of created documents per week, etc. You can filter them on a specific time period.

- **Search**: Provides statistics on how search filters are used and which queries users enter.

- **Workflow**: Provides statistics on tasks, such as the average duration of a workflow, actions per users, etc.

## Users and Groups

Only administrators and power users can create, edit and delete users and groups. They can create new users and groups, modify their properties or delete them. You can also connect the Platform to an external directory such as an LDAP.

Users can only consult users and groups directories.
