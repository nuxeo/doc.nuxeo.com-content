## Themes

Nuxeo Web UI provides several themes to change the look and feel of the UI. For the moment, they mostly provide color schemes applied to UI elements and a background image for some themes.

The available themes are:

- Default
- Dark
- Garden
- Kawaii
- Light
- Ocean

**To change your theme**:
- Go to **User Settings** menu > **Themes**.
- Click on **APPLY** next to the theme that you want to try.

{{#> callout type='note' }}
Your theme is saved browser-side, which means that if you use another browser you will have the default theme.
{{/ callout}}

## Sign Out

## UI Language

Web UI uses the browser's language. If the language that you have defined in your browser is not available in Web UI, it falls back on English.
