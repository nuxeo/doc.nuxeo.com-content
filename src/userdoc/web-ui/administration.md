This Administration menu presents different submenus:

## Analytics

This section of the Administration tab enables administrators to have information and statistics on how the application is used.

The default Activity subtabs are:
- **Document Distribution**: Provides statistics on the documents types, their size and counts.

- **Repository Content**: Provides statistics on the repository, the top downloads, the document created per week, etc. You can filter these statistics on a specific time period.

- **Search**: Provides statistics on the queries done by users and how search filters are used.

- **Workflow**: Provides statistics on tasks, like the average duration of a workflow, the actions per users, etc.

## Users & Groups

Only administrators and power users can create, edit and delete users and groups. They can create new users and groups, modify their properties or delete them. It is also possible to connect the Platform to an external directory (LDAP directory for instance). Users can only consult users and groups directories.

  An invitation email is sent to the user at the email address you filled in. The user account is pending the user validation and the user account is not available in the user search results.
- To validate the invitation, click on the validation link in the invitation email. Define your password and click on the **Submit** button. You are redirected to the login page of the Nuxeo Platform: you can now log in and use the Platform.
