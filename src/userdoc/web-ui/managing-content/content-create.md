## Creating a Document Using the Create Button

## Importing Documents Using Drag and Drop

Drag and drop is based on the HTML 5 standard and is available on all browsers that support the HTML 5 Drag and drop, without extension. Basically, this includes all browsers supported by the Nuxeo Platform and the Web UI:

{{{multiexcerpt 'webui-supported-browsers' space='nxdoc' page='web-ui-overview'}}}

See the [complete requirements]({{page space='nxdoc' page='web-ui-overview'}}#requirements).

You can use drag and drop to easily import content into a workspace or just to create one document at a time. Two types of import are available:

- Quick import, that enables to quickly create documents in workspace
- Import with properties, that enables to fill in metadata of the document(s) before they are created in the workspace

### Quick Import of Documents

To import content into Nuxeo, drag an item from your computer and drop it into a workspace. The document is then automatically created in the workspace and its title is the name of the original file, and no properties are filled in.

- You can drag and drop one or more files of any type in Nuxeo, directly in the workspace concerned.
- You can also drag and drop one or more files of any type from the **Import** tab of the creation popup. On this popup you can also edit the **Location** of your import.
  ![]({{file name='import-popup-web-ui.png'}} ?w=450,border=true)

{{#> callout type='tip' }}
You can import documents from a **custom encoded** Zip. For the preview to work correctly, you can follow the following instructions: [ZipFile Handling Details]({{page space='nxdoc' page='preview'}}#zipfile-handling-details)
{{/ callout}}

### Import with Properties

{{#> callout type='tip' }}
You can start adding properties before all the files are uploaded.
{{/ callout}}

It is possible to do a drag and drop import of documents with an additional step to fill in some properties. This prevents you from editing the documents after the import is done.

**To import documents with metadata:**

1. Drag your file from your desktop to the workspace main area in the browser.
    The file is uploaded. When the upload is done, the creation popup on the **Import** tab is displayed.
    ![]({{file name='dnd-web-ui.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)

2. Click on **ADD PROPERTIES**.
3. Fill in the properties that you need and then decide if you want to **EDIT NEXT** or **APPLY TO ALL** your modifications.
    ![]({{file name='add-properties-web-ui.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)
4. Once it's done click on **CREATE**.

The file is created with the filled in properties.

## Creating Content Using Nuxeo Drive

{{{excerpt 'userdoc/nuxeo-drive'}}}

You can very easily import document by moving them from a desktop folder to a Nuxeo Drive folder, or creating office files directly in a Nuxeo Drive folder. Read the [Nuxeo Drive documentation]({{page version='' space='client-apps' page='nuxeo-drive'}}) for more information.

## Automated Metadata Extraction

{{{multiexcerpt 'automated-metadata-extraction-excerpt' page='creating-content'}}}

Read the [Binary Metadata]({{page space='nxdoc' page='binary-metadata'}}) documentation for more information.


## Nuxeo Live Connect

Live Connect allows you to create a content application that handles cloud files (Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, OneDrive...) as if they were local files. Files remain in the cloud but they are referenced in the Nuxeo repository as if they were stored within it. This allows the user to benefit from thumbnailing service, full text, conversions, etc.

Live Connect for Google Drive also brings the "Cloud Edit" mode. Your application based on the Nuxeo Platform can provide the users with a direct link to the SaaS applications that you can use for editing Google Drive files (Google Docs, Office 365, Pixlr, etc.).

Read the [Live Connect]({{page space='nxdoc' page='nuxeo-live-connect'}}) documentation for more information.

## Creating Personal Documents

The personal workspace menu gives you a direct access to your collections and personal documents. Personal spaces can only be accessed by their owner, by default. You can of course share the access to your personal space with other users.

Content creation and edition, as well as management, works the same way in personal space as in workspaces.

To create personal documents, follow the same steps as for any other documents and it will be displayed in your personal space.
