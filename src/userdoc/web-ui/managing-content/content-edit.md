{{! excerpt}}
Editing a document consists in modifying its content (i.e. the attached file of a file document, the text of a note, etc.), as well as simply editing the title, description or any property of the document.
{{! /excerpt}}

You can also edit documents using Nuxeo Drive. For more information, see [Nuxeo Drive Editing Documents]({{page space='client-apps' page='nuxeo-drive'}}#editing-documents).

## Editing Properties

Properties of the documents, a.k.a. metadata, ensure that the document is referenced more accurately. Some properties are automatically filled in by the system, but most of them need to be filled in by users. When you create a document (file, note, workspace, section, or any other document type), its properties are empty.

The Nuxeo Platform uses Dublin Core metadata by default, although not all of them are displayed to the user by default. Dublin Core metadata is:

{{{multiexcerpt 'metadata' page='nxdoc/editing-content'}}}

Although properties are not mandatory, filling them in will make your documents easier to find using [Nuxeo search engine]({{page space='userdoc' page='search'}}).

**To edit a property:**

1. Click on the Edit button in the document actions toolbar ![]({{file name='edit-icon_web-ui.png' page='icons-index'}} ?w=16)
    ![]({{file name='edit-metadata-web-ui.png'}} ?w=250,border=true)
1. Edit the metadata that you want.
1. Once it is done, click on **SAVE**.

## Moving Documents Using Drag and Drop

In a content view, drag and drop is available to move documents from a folderish document to another (like workspaces, folders, or collections).

1. From your folder view, select the document you want to move.
1. Click on the selected documents and drag them.
1. Drop them on the folderish document you want.

## Moving Documents Using the Clipboard

The clipboard lets you easily copy or move content from one location (workspace, folder, etc.) to another. You can add as many documents as needed to the clipboard: adding documents does not replace the previous selection, it only adds more to the clipboard list. </br>

{{#> callout type='info'}}
Copying or moving content works in batches, meaning that the whole document list is copied or moved. It is therefore not possible to chose which document in the clipboard is to be copied or moved, or not. All documents in the clipboard are treated at once.
{{/callout}}

**Prerequisite:**

Copying and moving documents requires to have at least **Read** permission on the original document and **ReadWrite** permission in the target workspace (see [Permissions]({{page version='' space='userdoc' page='permissions'}}) page for more information).

**To copy or move document using the clipboard:**

1. On your instance, go to **Browse** > **Domain** and navigate to the desired source location (workspace, folder, etc.).
1. In View mode, display the content you want to add to the clipboard or directly check it from the list of documents.
1. Click on the **Add to Clipboard** {{!--     ### nx_asset ###

**Working with copied documents**

Once documents have been copied or moved using the clipboard, please note that they have their own working logic. Applying tags, versions, comments, etc., on a copied document is done on the working document itself. It is not shared between the source and target document.
