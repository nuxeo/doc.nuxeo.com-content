It is possible to add attachments to [Files]({{page page='document-types'}}) and [Notes]({{page page='document-types'}}) using the **Files** tab. This tab is available to users with at least Edit permission. There is no limit to the number of attachments.

**To add attachments to your document:**

1.  Click on the **Files** tab.
2.  Click on the **Add** button.
3.  Select one or several files to attach to the document.
    ![]({{file name='attachments_files_tab.png'}} ?w=400,border=true)
4.  Click on **Store uploaded files**.
    The files are attached to the document. The **Store uploaded files** button is not displayed anymore.
    The content of attachments is indexed and you can preview them from the **Summary** tab of the document.
    ![]({{file name='attachments_summary_tab.png'}} ?w=500,border=true)

**To remove attachments:**

1.  Click on the **Files** tab.
2.  Click on the icon ![]({{file name='delete.png' page='icons-index'}}) of the attachment to remove.
    The attachment is immediately deleted.

**Notes:**

*   Attached files are not synchronized with [Nuxeo Drive]({{page version='' space='nxdoc' page='nuxeo-drive'}}).
*   There is no versioning option from the **Files** tab by default. This means that you need to edit the document and increment its version manually after you updated attachments to make sure they are saved in a new version of the document.

**How to enable the Files tab on custom document types?**

To enable the Files tab on your own document types, make sure it holds the schema `files`.
