The Nuxeo Marketplace is the Nuxeo application store for DAM and ECM. It offers Nuxeo Packages that enable you to easily add features to your Nuxeo application. Create your own application by connecting to your existing systems, adding new features to your application or even make your package available to a wider audience!

The Marketplace offers packages aimed at developers and other that provide new features to end-users. The list of all Nuxeo Packages is [on the Marketplace](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace).
