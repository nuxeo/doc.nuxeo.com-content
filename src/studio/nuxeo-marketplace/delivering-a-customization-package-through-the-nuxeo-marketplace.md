The Nuxeo Marketplace is the channel provided by Nuxeo to distribute addons and patches to the Nuxeo Platform. [nuxeoctl]({{page space='nxdoc' page='nuxeoctl-and-control-panel-usage'}}) provides an integrated way to browse this catalog of add-ons and install them.

This catalog of packages is public, although some addons require a valid Nuxeo Online Services account to be able to install them.

The Nuxeo Marketplace also provides a private channel to distribute packages to a specific audience. Nuxeo Online Services users can provide their own users with the same safe, integrated method of browsing and installing private packages.

## Example Use Cases

The purpose of the private channel is to enable Nuxeo Platform users who do some customization on the Platform to easily distribute their customization. Here are some examples of how this private channel can be helpful.

For example, if you configure your Nuxeo instance with Nuxeo Studio, or Nuxeo CLI for additional Java customization, you can create your Nuxeo Package and allow other people (e.g. a sysadmin) to install the whole project using a single package, instead of installing them separately. Once the private package is uploaded on Nuxeo Marketplace, the Application Definition screen in your Nuxeo Studio project lets you bundle them easily.

Another example is if you create your own application on top of the Nuxeo Platform and distribute it to your own clients (who may add Studio configurations themselves), you can use this private channel to provide hotfixes of your base application.

## Who Can Use the Private Marketplace Channel

The Nuxeo Marketplace private channel is available to any Nuxeo Online Services user. Nuxeo Online Services trial users can also use it.

## Requirements

The Marketplace private channel can be used to provide any type of customization: simple XML configuration, Java code, configuration templates, libraries, etc. The only requirement is that the customization must be provided [as a Nuxeo Package]({{page space='nxdoc' page='creating-nuxeo-packages'}}).

## Uploading a Nuxeo Package

### Using the Marketplace Interface

**To provide customers with a private package:**

1. After logging in, navigate to [Nuxeo Marketplace upload page](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/upload) page or click on the button **Add your Nuxeo Package to the Marketplace**, located at the bottom of the screen.
2. Fill in the form "Upload a Marketplace package" (see below for details).
3. Click on the **Submit** button.</br>
  The package is uploaded. It can be [installed using nuxeoctl]({{page page='installing-a-new-package-on-your-instance' space='nxdoc'}})

See the documentation for [Creating Nuxeo Packages]({{page space='nxdoc' page='creating-nuxeo-packages'}}#create-an-empty-nuxeo-package) and [the Nuxeo Package code samples](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-marketplace-sample/).</td>

<td colspan="1">Select the organizations for which the package should be available for use, having read-only access.

### Using the REST API

A REST API is available for automation (such as integrating the upload of the Nuxeo Package from a release script or from the Continuous Integration).

{{#> panel type='code' heading='Sample calls from command-line with curl'}}
```bash
# Upload a package: orgId parameter is required, restrictedToOrgs is optional
curl -i -u login:token -F package=@/path/to/MP.zip "https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/upload?batch=true&orgId=[ownerOrgId]&restrictedToOrgs=[restrictedToOrgIds]"

# Delete a package
curl -i -u login:token -X DELETE "https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/delete/PACKAGE_ID"
```
{{/panel}}

where:

- the `orgId` parameter is the organization id that should own the package.
- the `restrictedToOrgs` parameter takes a comma separated list of organization ids that should be able to use the package.
- the `PACKAGE_ID` is the name property written in the package's [package.xml file]({{page version='' space='nxdoc' page='creating-nuxeo-packages'}}#package-format), along with its version, e.g. `my-package-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`.
