## Global Presentation

The Nuxeo partner community builds, maintains and distribute Nuxeo connectors through the Nuxeo Marketplace.

Production-ready addons need to follow standard requirements to be recognized as **Nuxeo Certified**:
- The addon will be available for the current Long Term Support versions, and the next one.
- The addon will follow coding best practices (more info on the [Nuxeo Core Developer Guide](https://doc.nuxeo.com/corg/)).
- Nuxeo has access to the sources of the addon.
- The vendor commits to delivering user documentation and configuration documentation of the plugin in English.
