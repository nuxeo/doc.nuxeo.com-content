You need to make sure that your Studio project has a correctly configured target version of Nuxeo Platform and the required packages. The target platform is the version of Nuxeo Platform for which the configuration will be generated. It should match the version of the Nuxeo Platform you are using. Updating the target version of Nuxeo Platform and its packages will have two main impacts:

*   You will probably have **more features available** than if you are on an older version, as Nuxeo Studio will be able to leverage all the new features/configurations brought with this version.
*   You will be 100% sure that what is generated by Nuxeo Studio is **compliant with the version of the product you are running**, as Nuxeo Studio is responsible for this.

To change the target platform, for instance to Nuxeo Platform LTS 2017, just follow the steps mentionned on the following screenshot.
