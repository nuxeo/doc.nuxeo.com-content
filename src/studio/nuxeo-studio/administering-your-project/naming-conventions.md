This page provides naming conventions for Studio items configuration to make usage, maintenance and support easier.

Using Naming Conventions enables you to debug more efficiently. By investigating `server.log`, you can instantly identify which type of configuration caused an error.
It also ensures better investigation of your issues by the Support Team.

{{#> callout type='tip' heading='quick switcher' }}
By using prefixes, you can find elements of your configuration more easily.
You can jump between any Studio feature or menu in a snap by typing its name. This action can be triggered by clicking the **Jump To** option on the bottom left of your Studio project or using the Ctrl + K / ⌘ + K shortcut.
{{/callout}}

We strongly encourage you to follow these, especially if you are a beginner.

## General Rules

- Use pascal case naming convention (initial uppercase letter).
  - Example: `PascalCase`
- Use underscore `_`, instead of hyphens `-`. Automation scripting doesn't work with items containing hyphens.

## Nuxeo Studio Modeler

### Content Model

| Item  | Rules | Example   |
|---|---|---|
| Document types | Pascal case naming convention | ContractLibrary |
| Schemas | Lower case, separated by underscore only if readability is affected | contract_library  |
| Properties | Camel case, not separated | contractNumber |
| Lifecycles | Pascal case naming convention | ContractLifecycle |
| Lifecycle states  | Camel case, not separated | ingestionInProgress |
| Lifecycle transitions  | `to_` followed by the lifecycle state name | to_ingestionInProgress |
| Structure templates | Pascal case naming convention, suffixed by `Factory` | ContractLibraryFactory  |

| Item  | Rules | Example   |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow templates | `WF_` followed by the workflow template name | WF_Contract |
| Workflow tasks | _Workflow task IDs are autogenerated by Nuxeo Studio Modeler_ | WF_SampleReview-20200410165513701-accept-reject-task  |

### Page Providers

| Item  | Rules | Example   |
|---|---|---|
| Page Providers | `PP_` followed by the document type name (if searching for a specific document type), and the search name | PP_Obsolete_Contracts |

### Automation

| Item  | Rules | Example   |
|---|---|---|
| Automation chains | `AC_` followed by the associated document type (if specific to a particular document type) and the automation name. | AC_Contract_UpdateLifecycle |
| Automation scripting | `AS_` followed by the associated document type (if specific to a particular document type) and the automation name. | AS_Contract_CreationPrefill |
| Event handlers | `EH_` followed by the associated automation chain/scripting name | EH_AS_Contract_CreationPrefill  |

### Templates

| Item  | Rules | Example   |
|---|---|---|
| Document templates | Camel case, suffixed by `DocTemplate` | ContractReportDocTemplate |

### Roles and Permissions

| Item  | Rules | Example   |
|---|---|---|
| Permissions | Pascal case naming convention | ReadWithoutDownload |

### Vocabularies

| Item  | Rules | Example   |
|---|---|---|
| Vocabularies | `VOC_` followed by the property name (if relevant), and the vocabulary name | VOC_ContractProvider |

### Advanced Settings

| Item  | Rules | Example   |
|---|---|---|
| XML Extensions | `XML_` followed by the extension point type (`actions`, `notifications`, `providers`, `doctype`...) and the configuration name. If relevant, add the associated document type, automation chain, workflow task triggering the mail template, an event, a button etc. | XML_notification_Contract_OnCreation |

| Document tabs | Pascal case naming convention, suffixed by `Page` | ContractAttachmentsPage |
| Drawer items | Pascal case naming convention, suffixed by `DrawerPage` or `MenuPage` depending on the its type | ContractsDrawerPage |
| Drawer menus | Pascal case naming convention, suffixed by `Page` | ContractsAdminPage |
