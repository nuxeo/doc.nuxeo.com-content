This page offers naming conventions for customizing Studio items to facilitate usage, maintenance and support.

We strongly encourage you to follow these, especially if you are a beginner.

## General rule

- Use pascal case naming convention (initial uppercase letter)
  - Example: `PascalCase`
- Avoid using hyphens (-) and use underscore. They will prevent your items to be usable by automation scripting.
