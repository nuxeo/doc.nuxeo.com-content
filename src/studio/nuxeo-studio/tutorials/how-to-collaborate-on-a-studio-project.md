This how-to explains how two users can work at the same time on a Studio Project. The two users will work on the `master` branch and in [Simple save mode]({{page page='commit-preferences'}}).

![]({{file name='simple_save_mode.png'}} ?w=250,border=true,thumbnail=true)

{{#> callout type='tip' }}

If you are not familiar with the revision control concept, you may want to have a look to the [branch management]({{page page='branch-management'}}) documentation before you start.

{{/callout}}

## Working Collaboratively

### First User

The first user wants to change the branding on the `master` branch.

1.  Go to **Branding**&nbsp;> **Login Screen**,
2.  Modify the background image of your login screen and click on **Save**.
    A message will appear at the top right and corner of your page saying that your changes are commited and pushed.

### Second User

Lets say that the second user wants to create a new document type on the `master` branch.

1.  Go to **Content Model**&nbsp;> **Document Types**,
2.  [Create a new document type]({{page space='nxdoc' page='how-to-define-a-document-type'}}) and click on **Save.**

While you are doing your modifications, at the top right and corner of your application, the pull icon&nbsp;![]({{file name='pull.png' page='studio-icons-index'}} ?w=32,thumbnail=true) is displayed to let you get the modifications of the User1\. You don't have to pull directly, you can wait until you have done all the modifications that you want.

![]({{file name='pull_popup.png'}} ?w=400,border=true)

## Conflicts

It may happens that the two users modify the same file, this generates a conflict. When it happens a pop-up window is displayed where you can select the version that you want to keep and complete the merge.

![]({{file name='mergePopup.png' page='commit-push-and-pull'}} ?w=650,border=true)

## Discover More

If you are familiar with the revision control concept, other save modes are available in the [Commit Preferences]({{page page='commit-preferences'}}) page in Studio: Intermediate and Advanced. If you want to try them, don't hesitate to contact your sales representative to activate them.

![]({{file name='sources-management.png'}} ?w=650,h=324,border=true)
