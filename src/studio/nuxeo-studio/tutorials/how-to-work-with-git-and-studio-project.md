Using Git in a Nuxeo Studio project and synchronize your sources with a local instance makes the development process of custom elements (pages, menus, buttons...) faster.
{{! /excerpt}}

{{#> callout type='info' heading='Nuxeo University'}}
Watch the [Web UI Customization and Nuxeo Frontend Development](https://university.nuxeo.com/learn/course/external/view/elearning/164/webui-customization-and-nuxeo-frontend-development) University course.

## Prerequisites

- A **running instance** of Nuxeo Server on your machine (example: http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/) to deploy your configuration.
- The **Nuxeo CLI** development tool to execute the replication operation. Please refer to [Nuxeo CLI]({{page space='nxdoc' page='nuxeo-cli'}}) to install it on your computer.
- A **Studio Project** connected to your Nuxeo Server to create the project which will be cloned locally.
- The **Branch Management** feature activated on your Studio Project. If you do not have it, you can only pull your Studio project without pushing the changes you have made locally. In this case, you have to manally copy your contribution in the Nuxeo Studio Designer interface, in the Resources tab.

{{#> callout type='info' heading='Git access'}}
Make sure a token to clone your Studio project has been created by following the instructions on the [Nuxeo Studio Designer Git Access]({{page space='studio' page='nuxeo-studio-designer-git-access'}}) documentation page.
{{/callout}}

{{#> callout type='warning' heading='Hot reload'}}
You must hot-reload your Nuxeo Studio Project once in your local server to allow the resources synchronisation
{{/callout}}

## Setup your dev environment

1. Open https://connect.nuxeo.com/ and navigate to **My Applications** tab
1. Find your project and copy the Git URL

--}}
![Studio_Git_URL.png](nx_asset://967edd4f-47c6-4635-a206-f0e8b811f34f ?w=650,border=true)
1. Create a new directory in your local workspace:
  ```
  mkdir my-custom-project
  ```
1. Go to `my-custom-project`:
  ```
  cd my-custom-project
  ```
1. Clone the Studio project:</br>
  - Example: `git clone https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/git/my-studio-project.git`
1. Synchronize your git project with your Nuxeo server:
  ```
  nuxeo sync --src <path of your project> --dest <path to the UI folder of your nuxeo server instance>
  ```
  - Example: `nuxeo sync --src university-SANDBOX/studio/resources/nuxeo.war/ui/ --dest nuxeo-server-10.2-tomcat/nxserver/nuxeo.war/ui/`

You should see the synchronization process, with `MKDIR`, `COPY` or `DELETED` instructions on your command line editor:

All the actions executed on your local Git project (creation, edition, deletion) are instantly replicated to your local Nuxeo server. To visualize your modifications, you have to refresh your web browser.

## Push Your Contribution into Your Studio Project

When you have finished your modifications, commit and push your code so it will be visible in the Nuxeo Studio Project.

A standard development flow with Studio Designer can be:
1. Create a development branch from Nuxeo Studio
  - Example:`feature/new-doctype`
1. Build some Modeler contribution which are needed for your Designer project
  - Example: Creation of a new document type in Studio Modeler and its associated layouts in Studio Designer
1. Get your Studio Project locally so that you can work on the Designer contribution
```
git clone https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/git/my-studio-project.git
git pull feature/new-doctype
```
1. Create your custom code.
  - Example: Rework the document type layouts and add some custom client side validations rules  

Once finished, push your contribution:
```
git add -A
git commit -m 'New Document Type with Layouts'
git push
```
1. Go back to your Studio Project on https://connect.nuxeo.com
1. Integrate your changes in your Studio Project by clicking the icon ![]({{file name='pull.png' page='studio-icons-index'}} ?w=32): The contributions will be shared between all the contributors.


## Tips and Tricks

{{#> callout type='warning' heading='Cache management with FT 10.2'}}
As the cache management policy is strict on FT 10.2, you may have to clear you cache to visualize your changes
{{/callout}}

- A `.gitignore` file can not be added to your project
- Make sure that you are not editing the default `nuxeo-<PROJECT-NAME>-bundle.html` file, but the `nuxeo-<PROJECT-NAME>-custom-bundle.html` to make your element imports and your slot contributions
