Some of the features of Studio rely on displaying a list of existing document types. For instance, that is the case when:

*   you configure a user action filter,
*   you use the content-template feature (you choose the type of node you add),
*   you configure the containment rules in the types definition.

{{! excerpt}}

That list&nbsp;of available document types is made from some pre-declared built-in types (Workspace, Folder, File, ...) and the ones created in Studio.

It happens that you don't find in that list the type you are looking for, mainly because:

{{! /excerpt}}

*   We forgot to add some built-in types (at the time this page is created it is the case of Forum, Website, MailFolder, ...);
*   You have deployed on your application some packages that contributes new document types, externally from Studio.

Fortunately we added a way to extend the list of available types, using the "Registries".

![]({{file name='Studio_registries_menu.png'}} ?w=310,border=true)

What you need to do to declare a missing document type is insert a JSON declaration (written by yourself) in the Registries, that will provide the following information on the document type:

*   parent,
*   schemas,
*   facets,
*   subtypes,
*   actions.

{{#> callout type='info' }}

Note that the information given in the JSON declaration are used only by Studio, to complete its user interface: it has no influence at all on the package/plugin generated by Studio or, as a consequence, on the behavior of your application. As a direct corollary, it is not mandatory to give the exhaustive information on actions, schemas, facets, subtypes, ... Only those required by what you need in the Studio interface.

{{/callout}}

Below are step-by-step instructions.

**To declare a missing document type in Studio:**
Here, we want to add the "Forum" in the built-in types of the content-template feature, and in the container list.

1.  Click on **Settings**, at the bottom of the left column by default.
2.  Click on **Registries** to unfold the Registries menu.
3.  Click on **Document Types** to add a missing document type.
4.  Copy-paste the example provided in Studio.
5.  Change the ID "MyFile" by "Forum" and edit the information so you get this:

    ```
    {
    doctypes: {
    Forum: {
          parent: "Document",
          schemas: ["dummy_schema"],
          facets: [],
          subtypes: [],
          actions: []
       }
    }
    }

    ```

6.  Click on the **Save** button.
    The immediate effect will be to add "Forum" in all the lists, which might be enough for our use case.

{{#> callout type='tip' }}

If you want to use the type registry to inherit from an external type, you will have to give the exact schemas and the exact facets as they are inherited.

{{/callout}} {{#> callout type='tip' }}

If you want to edit some layouts (forms) on properties declared in existing externally defined schemas, you will have to contribute schemas in registries.

{{/callout}}
