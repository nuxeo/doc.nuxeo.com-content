Discover upcoming and recent changes in Nuxeo Studio.

## Upcoming Changes
<!-- 3.8.0 -->
### Easier Search Configuration

#### Required Fields Mapping in Search and Listings Configuration

When configuring a UI element for a search or a listing, schemas and names coming from your page provider predicates and aggregates will be prefilled to ensure a quicker configuration.

When updating the configuration of the page provider, a warning in Designer appears to inform you that you need to update the UI configuration as well.

#### Improved Default Configuration for Search Elements

Studio generates checkboxes elements instead of drop-down lists by default when drag and dropping aggregates in your layouts configuration.

#### Automatic Range Label Usage

When configuring range aggregates, if no translation has been defined, Studio uses their label by default.
