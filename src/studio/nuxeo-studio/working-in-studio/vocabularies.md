{{{multiexcerpt '3-types-vocabulary' page='NXDOC:How to add a New Vocabulary'}}}

{{{multiexcerpt 'disabling-feature' page='branding'}}}

In each of these three types of vocabulary you will find identical parameters like:

- **Creation Policy**: The Creation Policy defines whether the values are created when the configuration is deployed on a Nuxeo Platform instance.
  - **Don't override existing values** means that it will be deployed only if it has never been deployed before on the instance. If it is already here, it will let the existing values as is.
  - **Always** means it will override the existing values with the ones that are on Studio. It should be used with a lot of attention, as there is no way to revert, if data has been deleted at deployment.
  - **Never** would be used so as to disable the data loading logic temporarily, but would still declare the directory.
- **Delete** and **Delete all**: Used to delete the values.
- **Import CSV:** Opens a pop-up with inline documentation. You can either import data in Studio from a CSV file **or** references a file that is never "parsed" from Studio (only by your Nuxeo Platform at deployment time). Choose the second option if you have many lines, for a better user experience with your Studio project. The first line of the CSV file is the header that defines the vocabulary fields: id, label, obsolete, ordering, and parent for hierarchical vocabularies. See examples [Simple Vocabulary]({{file name='simple-vocabulary.csv'}}) and [Hierarchical Vocabulary]({{file name='hierarchical-vocabulary.csv'}}).

## The Simple Vocabulary

![]({{file name='STUDIO-simple-vocabulary.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)

This type enables you to create a simple one-level vocabulary. Make sure to fill in the fields Id and Label correctly, with no special characters in the Id's name.

These fields are the same as those on the [vocabularies management interface]({{page space='userdoc58' page='managing-vocabularies'}}).

## The Child Vocabulary

![]({{file name='STUDIO-child-vocabulary.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)

This type allows you to link vocabularies between them in order to have parent and child vocabularies.

You can't create a Child Vocabulary if you don't have a Parent Vocabulary already created to select. Once your Child Vocabulary is created, you can add vocabulary entries and select a Parent for each of them by clicking on **Select** button and choose a Parent in the drop down list.

## The Hierarchical Vocabulary

![]({{file name='NuxeoStudioHierarchicalVocabularyMainView.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)

This types has more parameters than the others:

- **Add Root**: Adds a root value. Adding a value means giving an id, a label and an obsolete field, the same values you would find in the Nuxeo Platform [vocabulary screen edition]({{page space='userdoc' page='managing-vocabularies'}}) interface.
- **Add child**: When already on a node, adds a child element. Note that you have to click on the "Set tree depth" button if you want to add more children than the currently set limit.
- **Move up** and **Move down**: Used to move the values (that are ordered).
- **Set tree depth:** Allows to set more than two degrees of values on a hierarchical vocabulary. Select2 widgets are directly compatible with any levels. If you want to have more than two levels with chain selects, you can read the [Create a n-level select widget how-to]({{page space='nxdoc' page='how-to-create-a-n-level-select-widget'}}).

## Default Vocabularies

All vocabularies editable from the user interface are listed in the vocabularies menu entry.

To manage a vocabulary or its entries, go to **Administration > Vocabularies** and select the vocabulary you want to consult in the drop down list.
