## Document Templates

Document templates are used as conversion instructions, to render XML, HTML, CSV or any open format from a document or a list of documents, using specific rendering operations. You would especially want to use this when you handle business data on content types and want to generate a nicer presentation for publishing, export, etc.

## Mail Templates

An email template defines the content of an email that is sent to users under predefined circumstances. An email template is usually composed of text and variables. Typically, email templates are used to define the content of email alerts in the Nuxeo Platform.

It can be used in the "Notification > Send Email" operation, or when notification emails are sent during a workflow.

When downloading the Nuxeo Platform, users will access some default mail templates. However, then can also be created.
