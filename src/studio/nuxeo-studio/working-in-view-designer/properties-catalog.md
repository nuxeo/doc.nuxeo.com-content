{{#> callout type='info' heading='Availability'}}
This feature is available for target platforms Nuxeo Platform LTS 2016 and above.
{{/callout}}

The right panel displays the element catalog which can be integrated in the document form. You can find the document type fields, in edit or view template, search within the nuxeo element catalog, or even from within your custom elements, and drag n drop them.

## Catalog

### Elements by fields

The Elements section lists all the elements depending on the annotation defined for the element property that you are currently working on. If using a `@doctype` annotation this will present all:
- Herited schemas
- Custom properties
- Custom external schemas

In every schemas you will find the associated properties and the field format. Three modes are available by now: View, Edit and Column that you can drag'n'drop in the main view to use it.
