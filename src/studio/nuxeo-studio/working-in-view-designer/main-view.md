The code editor mode is an HTML editor to let you inspect every elements and directly modify your layout. You can delete, modify, update, copy/paste, drag and drop every elements that you want.

The HTML mode includes a few helpers such as auto-completion for document properties, tasks properties, and functions and polymer behaviours. The annotation `@doctype`, `@schema` or `@task` defined for each property defines the auto-completion for that property.

Don't forget to save your modifications, by clicking on the Save button ![]({{file name='save-action-vd.png'}} ?w=20,border=true) at the top right hand corner of your application.
