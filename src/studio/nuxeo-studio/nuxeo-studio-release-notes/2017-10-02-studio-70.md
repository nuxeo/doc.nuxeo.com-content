This version improves flow between Designer and Modeler, polishes autocompletion in automation scripting and brings bug fixes.
{{! /multiexcerpt}}

## Improved Flow Between Studio Modeler and Designer
One of the frequent feedbacks we received is that you want to be able to switch faster from Modeler to Designer (and vice versa of course).

If you fall in that category, you will be glad to learn that buttons will now appear where appropriate to let you switch from one to the other, directly to the corresponding screen. When creating a document type for instance, configuring its layouts is now one click away.

![]({{file name='configure-layouts.png'}} ?w=591,h=185,border=true)

From Designer, a configure button is also available to take you back to your document type configuration.

![]({{file name='configure-doctype.png'}} ?w=325,h=140,border=true)

Similar options are provided for page providers and workflows.

## Further Polished Automation Scripting Experience
Autocompletion experience is one of the key points when using automation scripting. We felt like it still wasn't satisfying enough, so we tweaked it again with the goal to make it more stable and predictable.

Suggestions will now be offered as much as possible, but autocompletion only triggered when you explicitly request it. Here is an extract from one of our user stories as an example:

- type Lo, suggestions are offered but can be discarded by pressing esc.
- type Lo, you are offered Log => selecting it triggers autocompletion, otherwise autocompletion is not triggered.
- type Log, you are offered Log => selecting it triggers autocompletion, otherwise autocompletion is not triggered.
- type Log, you are offered Log => select it => autocompletion is triggered => press ctrl+z => autocompletion is cancelled.

We also added missing autocompletion options related to logging: `print`, and `Console.[info, warn, error]` (see the [automation scripting documentation]({{page space="nxdoc" page="automation-scripting#javascript-logging"}}) for details).

Feel free to let us know how you feel about it, we're always happy to receive your feedback!

## Noticeable Bug Fixes

- When editing a workflow node, popup size is now adapted to prevent horizontal scrolling ([NXS-4273](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4273)).
