Studio will now show your work in progress changes, commits to push or pull. It can be used to monitor your work status, and also to [review configuration changes]({{page page='how-to-review-nuxeo-studio-configuration'}}) made by others.
{{! /multiexcerpt}}

## Work Status Display
When looking at your current branch in the branch management screen, Studio will now display two zones.

### Work in Progress Zone
Displays anything that is not shared with your coworkers yet.
- Your work in progress with a blue indicator
- Commits you have not pushed yet with a green indicator

### Merged Commits Zone
Displays all commits that are in the main branch.
- Commits with an orange indicator are not visible from you yet until you pull them.

This new feature can also be used to execute a configuration review process: we wrote a [configuration review tutorial]({{page page='how-to-review-nuxeo-studio-configuration'}}) explaining this usage.

## Browser Support Information
Studio supports the latest Firefox and Google Chrome versions in the Modeler area. For Nuxeo Designer, only Google Chrome is currently supported. When using an unsupported browser, Studio will now show a warning message.

## Noticeable Bug Fixes

- The code editor in Studio Designer could not load in some situations. This is now fixed ([NXS-4450](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4450)).
- It is now possible to use long commit messages in Nuxeo Studio ([NXS-4423](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4423)).

[More information about bugs fixed in this version](https://jira.nuxeo.com/issues/?jql=project %3D NXS AND fixVersion IN %28'73.4'%29) is available in our bugtracking tool.
