{{! multiexcerpt name='summary-v73-11-1'}}
This release makes it easier to create a document type when using Web UI.
{{! /multiexcerpt}}

## Easier Document Type Creation Process
When configuring a document type, the **SVG icon** option is now available if your application has a dependency to the **Web UI** addon.

![]({{file name='svg-icon.png'}} ?border=true,w=445)

From there, you can select any SVG file available in the Studio project resources or upload your own. This file will automatically be used in Web UI's document creation popup dialog.

If you have already configured your document type icons by uploading the corresponding files in Designer's **Resources** tab, they can be kept and will override the configuration made in the **SVG icon** field.

## Noteworthy Improvements and Bugfixes

- When using Web UI, the Resolution Actions tab is now available to configure your workflow tasks buttons  ([NXS-4689](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4689)).
- Tabs in automation scripting are now consistent (converted to 2 spaces in both manually written and auto-formatted scripts) ([NXS-4691](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4691)).

[More information about bugs fixed in this version](https://jira.nuxeo.com/issues/?jql=project %3D NXS AND fixVersion IN %28'73.11','73.11.1'%29) is available in our bugtracking tool.
