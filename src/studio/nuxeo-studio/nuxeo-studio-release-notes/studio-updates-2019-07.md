## Released Changes

{{! multiexcerpt name='studio-updates-2019-07-changes'}}
### Actions Renamed As Buttons

Actions menu in Designer are renamed as `Buttons`, and the related options as follows:
- `Operation Action` is now `Button`: Choose this option to create a button using configuration only.
- `Action` is now `Custom Button`: Choose it to create your own button element using code for extensive capabilities.

Icons reflect the options more clearly.

The `+` button in Designer is refreshed to be more explicit:
- Tooltips are shown on the option you choose,
- When only two options are available, clicking the `+` button directly leads you to the one that is the simplest to use.

### Better Contextual Help

Studio Designer shows contextual help on click so that you can copy/paste code samples and click on documentation links.

### Help In Page Provider Configuration

- Contextual help is added to guide you on:
  - choosing an aggregate type between ranges, histogram and terms options
  - defining ranges
  - adding a quick filter
- Date format and interval provide a default value and guidance to let you tweak it, quick filter clause has a placeholder to guide you on the query format
- Format field for range aggregates and interval field for histogram aggregates are properly marked as required, and regrouped with other required fields for faster configuration
- Quick filter name is shown in the user interface when no translation has been defined for it

### Search on File Type or Size

It is possible to define aggregates on the sub-fields for a blob property. It can be used to provide search options to find files of a specific type, or based on the file size for example.

Use the `histogram` or `range` aggregate types in combination with the `length` property for the file size, the `terms` aggregate with the `mime-type` property for the file type.

These options work with any blob property, multivalued ones as well.

### Other Noteworthy Mentions

{{! multiexcerpt name='studio-updates-2019-07-bugfix'}}
- Workflow graph looks consistent between Studio and Web UI when using a fork node ([NXS-5292](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-5292)).
- Studio prevents you from using the same name for a content view and a page provider as it could lead to conflicts ([NXS-4590](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4590)).
- Page providers that are named similarly as a document type are correctly handled when generating a search form ([NXS-4736](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4736)).
