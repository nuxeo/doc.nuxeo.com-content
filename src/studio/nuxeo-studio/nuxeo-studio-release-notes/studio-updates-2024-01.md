## Connect / Account Management

Roles in Connect have evolved. With this release there will be three internal and three external roles.

**External Roles**

**Basic User**
This is the default type for external users  (clients, partners etc.) and gives access to that organisation’s packages 
Basic users can be added to services by Admins, giving them access to Studio projects and other features

**OrgAdmin**
This is role that allows a user to administer an organisation’s user via the Account Management feature

**SuperOrgAdmin (ex ProjectAdmin)**
This is a superior admin role that gives access Account Management and Project Admin features, as well a the ability to create OrgAdmins
