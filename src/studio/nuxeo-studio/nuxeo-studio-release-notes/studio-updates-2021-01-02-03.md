## Released Changes

{{! multiexcerpt name='studio-updates-2021-01-02-03-changes'}}

### Range Support for Marketplace Packages

Since LTS 2021, Nuxeo Marketplace packages support target platform ranges, allowing a released package to remain installable with a future version of the Nuxeo Platform.

This avoids re-releasing a new marketplace package when there is no code change. The application definition section of Nuxeo Studio now supports packages defined with ranges. You can refer to the [package.xml documentation](https://doc.nuxeo.com/nxdoc/next/package-manifest/) for further information about the target platform ranges.
