## Increase in the Max Number of Users per Organisation

We’ve increased the max number of users allowed for an organisation to a hundred thousand, as the current limit was impacting several larger users.  

## Removal of 11.x Platform in Studio

We’ve removed the possibility of setting 11.x as the compatible platform in Application Definition in Studio as this version is no longer compatible.

## Property to Remove Mobile Banner

We’ve added a property to remove the mobile banner.

## Resources Identified in Studio Registries

We’ve identified Resources in Studio registries as a way to a range of overriding issues stemming from a resource in a dependency not being accessible in the local project.

## Improvement to track Page Provider Usage

We’ve evolved the Page Provider properties to make it easier to track usage, notably using the `<trackUsage>` property.
