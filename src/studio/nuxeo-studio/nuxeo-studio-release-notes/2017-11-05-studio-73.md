## Studio Designer Public Beta Availability
Studio Designer, our newest addition, is now entering a public beta phase.

If you wish to give it a try:
- Go to your project's application definition screen.
![]({{file name='app-def.png'}} ?w=208,h=150,border=true)

- Add the Web UI dependency (available for Nuxeo Server LTS 2016 and above), then save.
![]({{file name='web-ui-dependency.png'}} ?w=438,h=165,border=true)

You will then be able to switch between Studio Modeler and Studio Designer at anytime by using the buttons at the top right of your screen.
