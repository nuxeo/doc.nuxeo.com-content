{{! multiexcerpt name='summary-v73-9'}}
You can now configure your project as a real application containing dependencies on any public addon without having to make a dedicated custom bundle.
{{! /multiexcerpt}}

## Declare Dependencies on any Package

Nuxeo Studio now lets you declare dependencies to any public marketplace addon, instead of a select few. This removes the need to setup a development environment and create a custom bundle in order to install all your dependencies automatically.

This work is the first step toward:
- adding dependencies to private packages and other Studio projects,
- having the features contained in all declared dependencies available into the current Studio project to leverage or override them.

## Noteworthy Improvements and Bugfixes

- When scaffolding a multivalued complex property, a table element will be created instead of scaffolding every property individually ([NXS-4524](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4524)).
- Studio will prevent empty commit messages made by mistake ([NXS-4524](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4524)).
- Duplicating a feature in Designer will now create an independent copy ([NXS-4552](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4552)).

[More information about bugs fixed in this version](https://jira.nuxeo.com/issues/?jql=project %3D NXS AND fixVersion IN %28'73.9'%29) is available in our bugtracking tool.
