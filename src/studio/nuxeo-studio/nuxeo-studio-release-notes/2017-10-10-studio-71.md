{{! /multiexcerpt}}

## Branches Listing Optimization
Branches listing screen has been optimized with this version, leading to an average 90% speed gain on larger projects with a hundred branches or more. It is also made to scale: feel free to create as many branches as you need.

## Noticeable Bug Fixes
- Older releases can now be deleted ([NXS-4171](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4171)).
- In event handlers, "current user is member of" tooltip is now accurate ([NXS-4249](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4249)).
