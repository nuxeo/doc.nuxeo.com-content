## REST API for Studio Releases

A REST API to create releases for your Studio project is now available. This new feature comes bundled with a set of changes to make your development flow and continuous integration setup easier.

### Simplified Maven GAV

In any branch, Studio will now display a simplified Maven GAV for your snapshots, that you can use to set up your continuous integration.

![]({{file name='studio-maven-gav-ci.png'}} ?border=true,w=600)

In contrast to previous Studio versions, this Maven GAV remains the same even after a release. Notice also that two options are provided depending on whether you want to test your work in progress, or only changes committed in the shared branch.

### Simplified Release Creation UI

The release creation popup is simplified in the Studio UI.

It no longer uses a next version number. Instead, it offers suggestions based on the latest release performed in the current branch.

### Rest API for Studio Releases

Releases can also be performed through a REST API to automate your release process. Below is an example.

```
Request:

POST https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/studio/v2/project/{project_id}/releases
Authorization: Basic base64({username}:{password})
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "revision": "{branch_name}",
    "versionName": "(M.m.p-q|MAJOR|MINOR|PATCH)"
}

Response:

Content-Type: application/json

{
    "version": "M.m.p-q",
    "bundleSymbolicName": "studio.extensions.{project_id}",
    "mavenCoordinates": "{project_group_id}:{project_id}:M.m.p-q"
}
```

Similarly to the Studio UI, Studio decides on the version number to create based on your input and last release performed. Check the [how to release your Studio project documentation]({{page page='how-to-tag-or-release-your-nuxeo-studio-project'}}) for more information on this new endpoint.

## Revamped Table Layout Editor

With this release comes a totally revamped visual editor for Studio Designer. It can be used to:
- [Configure multivalued fields]({{page page='layouts-designer'}}#configuring-multivalued-fields)
- Design [page provider table results layout]({{page space='nxdoc' page='web-ui-search'}})

Compared to its previous version, the user interface has been simplified; it is more consistent and user-friendly.

## Constraints on Node and Workflow Variables

Constraints can be defined on workflow variables and node variables. When defining a new variable, press the **Edit** button to decide on the rules to set.

![]({{file name='field-config-constraint.png'}} ?border=true,w=379)

![]({{file name='field-config-constraint2.png'}} ?border=true,w=351)

These constraints are defined at core level, meaning that they will be enforced in all cases: not only in the task forms but also when using automation operations, the REST API or even custom code.

## Noteworthy Improvements and Bugfixes

- Custom automation chains and scripts will now be suggested in Studio Designer when creating an action   ([NXS-4529](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4529)).
- Facet for document tagging is now exposed in Studio for Nuxeo Server 9.10 and up ([NXS-4486](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4486)).
- In Studio Designer actions screen, help is now consistent with creation options ([NXS-4482](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4482)).
- New event handlers will only apply to the regular document by default to prevent the error of trying to update an archived version ([NXS-4471](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4471)).
- Generated configuration for aggregate widgets does not depend on the widget mode anymore ([NXS-4490](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4490)).

[More information about bugs fixed in this version](https://jira.nuxeo.com/issues/?jql=project %3D NXS AND fixVersion IN %28'73.7','73.7.1','73.8'%29) is available in our bugtracking tool.
