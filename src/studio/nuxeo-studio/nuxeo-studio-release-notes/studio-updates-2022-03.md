## Annoucement : Technical Upgrade and New Version Numbering

We are happy to have released in March a major upgrade to the Nuxeo Online Services infrastructure. This has involved a range of changes, so please let us know if you encounter any errors. 

Going forward we will also align our verisoning to the Platform's system, that is every major version will carry the year in which it was released. Hence, technically, the next version of Nuxeo Online Services wwill be named 2022.1
