## Studio Designer Interface Improvements

The layouts and UI menus in Studio Designer has been merged into a single one. This provides greater consistency with Studio modeler and an easier user experience.

Menus change as following:
- `Layouts` are moved into a menu option and closed by default

![Layouts Change]({{file name='layouts-menu-change.png'}})

- `Document Pages` entry is renamed as `Tabs`

![Document Pages Change]({{file name='document-pages-change.png'}})

- `Left Menu Items` and `Main Menu Pages` are merged into a dedicated `Drawer` menu

![Left Menu Items Change]({{file name='left-menu-items-change.png'}})


## Noteworthy Improvements and Bugfixes
