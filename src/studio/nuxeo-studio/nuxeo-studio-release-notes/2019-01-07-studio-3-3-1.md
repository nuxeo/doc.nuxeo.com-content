Studio Designer interface improvements.
{{! /multiexcerpt}}

## Studio Designer Interface Improvements
The layouts and UI menus in Studio Designer are now merged into a single one. This provides greater consistency with Studio modeler and a simpler user experience.

Menus change as following:
- Layouts are merged into a menu option and closed by default
- `Document Pages` option is renamed as `Tabs`
- `Left Menu Items` and `Main Menu Pages` belong to a dedicated `Drawer` menu


## Noteworthy Improvements and Bugfixes

- Tags can be pushed using Git access ([NXS-4882](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4882)).
- A warning is given when using a query making use of the deprecated trash management behavior in content views ([NXS-5054](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-5054)).

[More information about bugs fixed since last release notes](https://jira.nuxeo.com/issues/?jql=project %3D NXS AND fixVersion IN %28'3.3.0','3.3.1'%29) is available in our bug tracking tool.
