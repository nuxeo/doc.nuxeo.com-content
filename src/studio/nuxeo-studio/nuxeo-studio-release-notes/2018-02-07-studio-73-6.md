{{! multiexcerpt name='summary-v73-6'}}
Studio now handles lost sessions gracefully, and provides advanced configuration patterns for JSF UI layouts' widgets.
{{! /multiexcerpt}}

## Offline Status Management

Studio will now prompt you to reauthenticate when trying to save anything while your session was ended due to inactivity. The authentication form will open in a new tab, so that once logged back in you keep anything you were doing that was not saved yet.

## Widgets Advanced Configuration Improvements
When configuring JSF UI layouts, the view properties of a widget will now always show up as soon as the advanced configuration field is set. This allows for some advanced configuration patterns: for instance determining the widget mode to apply depending on the result of a business logic call made through a Seam bean.

## Always on Top Current Branch
Studio now displays the current checked-out branch on top of the branches list. This small change makes it easier to check your work in progress.

## Noticeable Bug Fixes

- Reverting a layout now works properly ([NXS-4498](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4498)).
- All multivalued fields besides complex type can now be set as required at schema level ([NXS-4402](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4402)).
- Links are now more visible in help tooltips and some specific areas ([NXS-4240](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4240)).
- In Studio Designer, dates in workflow layouts are now human-readable ([NXS-4453](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4453)).
