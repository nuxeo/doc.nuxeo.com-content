Develop faster with Git access and Quick Switcher, JSF to Web UI migration early access release.
{{! /multiexcerpt}}

## Develop Faster
### Using Studio and Git Access
Latest Studio updates make your development flow faster if you learn how to leverage the tools at your disposal: see how you can display your Web UI customization changes instantly and push them back to Studio with our new [tutorial]({{page page="how-to-work-with-git-and-studio-project"}}).

### Using Quick Switcher
A new `Jump To` option is visible on the bottom left of Studio. Clicking on it or using the `Ctrl+k / Cmd+k` shortcut allows you to quickly switch to any other Studio feature or menu simply by typing its name. Goal is to make your flow more efficient by reducing the need to go though countless menus and browsing to find what you are looking for. Give it a try and <a href="https://portal.prodpad.com/eb062eda-6d54-11e7-8513-22000a2145da" target="_blank">let us know how it goes</a>!

## JSF to Web UI Migration - Early access
An automated tool to migrate your JSF UI configuration to Web UI is available in the new `migration services` screen from Studio Modeler. It is currently reserved to members of our [early access program]({{page page="early-access-program"}}).

## Additional Storage Options for Document References
When storing a document reference in a schema, new options are available for Nuxeo Server versions 10.1 and upper:
- Storing the document id with or without a repository prefix
- Storing the document path with or without a repository prefix
This is an advanced setting. Storing the document path can typically come in handy when importing documents and needing to store a reference to another imported document, as you wouldn't be able to know in advance the document id Nuxeo Server is going to create.

## `folder` Becomes a Reserved Keyword for Schema Name

As a consequence of this change, Studio displays a validation error when this keyword is used for a schema name. If you use it in your project, here is how to deal with it.

### I have a Folder doctype and made no configuration to it
#### What to do?
You can remove it as it is obsolete.

#### Explanations
Using this keyword will work as long as you don't add any custom property or do a custom layout. We are making the folder schema name reserved because we saw that our users tend to configure it at some point and run into a lot of trouble at runtime because of that.

### I have a Folder document type and made configuration to it (added custom properties to the folder schema for instance)
#### What to do?
Rename the `folder` schema to something different, e.g. `folder_schema`.

#### Explanations
`folder` is a default nuxeo server schema, using it in Studio will cause you trouble at runtime if you forget some default fields or misconfigure them. It will also make your application difficult to maintain in the long term because the default schema may evolve with nuxeo server versions.
