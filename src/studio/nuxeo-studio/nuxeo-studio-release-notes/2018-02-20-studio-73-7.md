{{! multiexcerpt name='summary-v73-7'}}
Introducing a revamped editor for page providers results layout configuration.
{{! /multiexcerpt}}

## Revamped Table Layout Editor

With this release comes a totally revamped visual editor for Studio Designer. It can be used:
- to [configure multivalued fields]({{page page='layouts-designer'}}#configuring-multivalued-fields)
- to design [page provider table results layout]({{page space='nxdoc' page='web-ui-search'}})

Compared to its previous version, the user interface has been simplified; it is more consistent and user-friendly.
