The [**Nuxeo Studio Community Cookbook**](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-studio-community-cookbook) is a GitHub repository containing Nuxeo Studio code samples that you can freely use in your Nuxeo Studio project. These samples are snippets for copy and paste, as opposed to Nuxeo Packages, i.e. there is nothing to build. Each module includes a readme that explains how to install and use the snippet. Each module may also include:

- Contributions for **Nuxeo Studio Modeler** (e.g. XML extensions, page providers, automation chains or automation scripts)
- Contributions for **Nuxeo Studio Designer** (e.g. layouts, bundle content, HTML resources)
